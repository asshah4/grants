			Annotation of coronary sinus EGMs using WFDB system?
			Machine learning approach for ECG and EGM annotation
				P waves could be annotated to corresponding coronary sinus EGM
				Similarly, could utilize CS to confirm ventricular activation as reflected by QRS complex
				Trainable in "real time" during EP study to some degree
		Surface electrocardiography
			Can ECG signal before and after AF ablation predict success of ablations?
			Can ECG signal predict contents of ablation maps?
	Epidemiology
		Stress reactivity
			ECG markers of stress reactivity
