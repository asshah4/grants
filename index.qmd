title: "Summary of Research Efforts"
---

This serves as a summary of current research progress, updates, and projects (clinical, translational, and programming). The most recent update to this page was as of `r format(Sys.Date(), "%A, %B %d, %Y")`. Please see here for weekly [updates](https://asshah4.github.io/research/t32/t32-updates.html).

The major research focuses are currently on:

1. __Stress and Cardiovascular Epidemiology__: Physiological and psychological stress and cardiovascular mortality, from a neurocardiac perspective.
1. __Stress and Arrhythmogenesis__: Mechanisms behind stress and arrhythmia generation (or degeneration) in a pre-clinical and clinical electrophysiology context.
1. __Computational Neurocardiology and Biostatistics__: Programming-based approaches in signal processing and biostatistics.
1. __Clinical Projects__: Work being done as a cardiology fellow at UIC/JBVA.

# Stress and Cardiovascular Epidemiology

- Effect of autonomic reactivity and resting vagal tone in cardiovascular mortality
- Depression and dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system
- Circadian variability in autonomic function and microvascular coronary disease

# Stress and Arrhythmognesis

## Atrial Fibrillation Registry

A catheter-ablation registry is being developed. The current status of the data acquisition process can be seen [here](https://asshah4.github.io/aflubber). No clinical data is available externally. 

# Clinical Projects

- Atrial fibrillation and efficacy of cardioversion
- Pulmonary embolism management with a coordinated response team (PERT)
- Endocarditis lesion characteristics in a gain-independent manner using pixel density changes
- Arrhythmia and device management in setting of endocarditis
