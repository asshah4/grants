# Atrial Arrhythmia Modulation Using NPY Y2R Blockade

## Background

- High levels of SNS stimulation are pro-arrhythmic for triggered activity
- Cross-talk between SNS/PNS at intracardiac level is critical in arrhythmia generation
- SNS releases both catecholamines + __NPY__
- __NPY__: causes vagolysis at level of cholinergic neurons through Y2R 

## Proposal

1. Murine model of pro-atrial arrhythmia
1. Whole heart + vagus nerve in Langendorf preparation
1. Vagal stimulation protocol for conduction property modulation
1. Catecholamine infusion + NPY infusion that removes protection 
1. NPY Y2R blockade returns vagal protective effect

# Atrial Fibrillation Clinical Phenotyping Using Machine Learning

## Background

- Currently use limited classification system:
	- Lone
	- Paroxysmal
	- Persistent
	- Long-standing Persistent
	- Permanent
- Does not capture underlying pathology, etiology, triggers, genetic components

## Proposal

Big data: 

1. Use "big data" approach
1. X-dimensionality clustering based on clincial covariates (support vector machines)
1. Weight importance of clinical factors

Validation: 

1. Validate with local cohorts and tie to both treatment + outcomes
1. Integration of intracardiac mapping data (voltage, geometry, volume, dominant frequency)
