# Atrial Arrhythmia Modulation Using NPY Y2R Blockade

## Background

- High levels of SNS stimulation are pro-arrhythmic for triggered activity
- Cross-talk between SNS/PNS at intracardiac level is critical in arrhythmia generation
- SNS releases both catecholamines + __NPY__
- __NPY__: causes vagolysis at level of cholinergic neurons through Y2R 

## Proposal

1. Murine model of pro-atrial arrhythmia
1. Whole heart + vagus nerve in Langendorf preparation
1. Vagal stimulation protocol for conduction property modulation
1. Catecholamine infusion + NPY infusion that removes protection 
1. NPY Y2R blockade returns vagal protective effect
