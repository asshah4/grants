# Overview

Goal is to have aims for T32 year from July 2022 to June 2024. Afterwards will be pursuing EP fellowship. Time breakdown will be...

| Focus | Obligation | Description | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Research | Translational/Basic Science | Either patch-clamping or stem cells, lab meetings |
| Research | Biostatistics/Epidemiology | HRV analyses with Amit, weekly meetings |
| General Cardiology | Clinic | 1-2 half days of clinic a week | 10% |
| General Cardiology | Studying | Boards and general cardiology conferences, roughly 4-5 hours a week | 10% |
| Electrophysiology | Preparation | Lab time and reading | 20% |

# Research 

__Area__: neurocardiology  
__Topic__: stress and arrhythmogenesis  
__Scope__: translational to clinical   
__Mechanism__: How does stress lead to arrhythmia at the population level, down to the cellular changes that precede and manifest as electrical disturbances?  

## Clinical Focus

## Translational Focus

Clinical: ECG-based risk assessment for stress, mortality, arrhythmia
Basic
