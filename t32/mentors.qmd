## Agenda

1. Project overview
1. Computational methods
1. Proposal 
1. Statistical concerns

## Project overview

*Can we predict the effect of TTN variants on atrial myopathy (and subsequent atrial fibrillation) using machine learning algorithms trained on ECG data?*

- Cohort of "early" (age < 65 onset) of AF with mix of WES and high-density candidate gene sequencing 
- `n=298` individuals overall and `n=36` individuals with **LP/P** variants in TTN (using SIFT/PolyPhen scores)
- `n=7953` unique ECGs that were thought to be in sinus rhythm from 2010 to 2023

## Computational methods

- Digital signal processing to extract ECG data (P wave, R wave, T wave) while in sinus
- Deep learning approach for feature extraction and classification 
- Novelty is in part using 12-lead approach and recurrent data (e.g. multiple ECG over time)
- End-to-end classification layer to combine pre-processing, filtering, clean-up

## Proposal

- Assumes multi-hit hypothesis on effect of TTN variants on atrial myopathy (e.g. effect on strain, fibrosis, etc)
- Assumes fibrosis/increase duration of AF episodes (unlikely to lead to initiation but contributes to maintenance)
- Identification of TTN-VUS in AF patients that *may* play a role in atrial remodeling
- Using VEP to evaluate 1) location of variants in bands of sarcomere, 2) focus on missense proteins (?) in addition to truncating and/or LOF variants
- Assess impact of variants on ECG

## Statistical concerns {.tiny}

- Power is limited based on number of individuals with TTN variants
- Multiple machine learning approaches needed that are "explainable" in terms of effect on ECG signal
- Validation of dataset
- Correct "ground truth" of pathology of TTN variants is difficult to confirm

# 01/10/24 | DD

# 11/21/23 | DD

## Agenda {.smaller}

- High level updates
	- EP fellowship ranklist
	- Lab meeting structure
	- AFL/FH paper: reviewer comments, discussion thoughts
- AFEQT/SDOH
	- Missing data issues
	- Defining outcomes
- ECG/TTN variants
	- Tentative plan and timeline

## AFEQT/SDOH {.smaller}

- `n = 51` patients had missing encounter dates but had provided baseline AFEQT scores
- `n = 388` unique patients from UIC currently with AFEQT at baseline and follow-up (not including JBVA data), however missing or inappropriate baseline dates (e.g. before AF registry *started*), approximately ~150 additional patients

Questions:

- [ ] How should we handle missingness?
- [ ] Should we call to obtain "baseline" data for recent patients? (approximately 150 additional patients from 2020 to now are available)

## ECG/TTN

1. Working on ECG findings with TTN variants currently
1. Abstract focus is on trainability of ECG-based model to help differentiate ECG in pathogenic variants of TTN versus controls in patients with atrial myopathy
1. Expect to have initial analyses complete in first week of December
1. HRS abstract deadline is December 15th

# 11/13/23 | AJS

## Agenda

- High level updates
	- EP fellowship
	- Lab meetings / collaborations (Louis Li?)

- ECG/TTN variants
- Next projects?
	- DM/GEH papaer
	- Twins/cosinor and $\psi$

## HRV/CVD {.tiny}

1. What elements of the results should we make sure to include? As MI, competing risk, etc are taken out, our points made in discussion about cause-specific nature are limited?
1. By taking out competing risks paragraph, the results section now is < 1 page (too *few* results was previously a concern)
1. Major findings in discussion should be both high risk and low risk groups? Dichotomous and categorical groups?

## AFEQT/SDOH/Phenotying AF {.smaller}

**Quantified** approaches to measure AF, progression, treatment:

- AFEQT on multiple visits *consider including this in EPIC in all AF consult/clinic notes*
- SDOH will include...
	- Sociodemographics, including education/income for some participants
	- Neighborhood deprivation indices
	- Payment method / insurance types
- Progression composed of repeat ECG in sinus or AF (including heart rate), medication intensification (now have dosages as well at each visit from CCTS), and intervention (DCCV, PVI)

*My next 3-4 weeks will be focused on cleaning and processing this data from CCTS*

## ECG/TTN 

- Shashank and Darren have joined on this project, will teach them DSP and ML approaches (taking them to the EP lab)
- Need to train an algorithm to identify chambers (P/QRS/T waves) with improved accuracy over current mechanisms
- Have to generate training and test data sets

*Next week will be dedicated to ML/signal processing efforts*

## PRS/AF {.smaller}

- Contacted NW about the SNP data
	- There are 165 SNPs that they utilized
	- Effect sizes for each SNP were also given (from their cohort)
- Actively completing power calculations now 
	- Have to decide how to use our VCF data from WES and from GWAS data
	- [ ] Can we leverage both the dense array data and WES to match the 165 SNPs?

## Outline

1. EP fellowship and timeline
1. Prioritizing projects
1. SDOH and arrhythmia outcomes
1. Phenotyping AF

## EP fellowship {.smaller}

Which locations should I prioritize for in terms of ideal training? When should I ask for personal recommendations?

- Northwestern
- Vanderbilt
- UPenn
- Johns Hopkins
- Stanford
- UCLA

## Prioritizing projects {.smaller}

1. AFL/FH revisions: plan for being done by the weekend
1. Phenotyping AF: complex project, currently working on ECG analysis with TTN genotypes
1. Mentees: currently have requests from x2 medical students, x2 residents, and am currently working with x1 student on SDOH/language barriers in AF
1. Committee: Currently everyone is reviewing my phenotyping proposal - most excitement is for ECG identification of genetic variants
1. eMERGE: need help with original and revised proposal - okay to ask VUMC staff about supporting/example documents?

## SDOH/Arrhythmia

- Urban Health Disparities grant to evaluate language barriers as mediator of AF care intensification (e.g. medications, cardioversion, referrals)
- Plans are to expand for ALL arrhythmias and EP referrals
- Mediation analysis for neighborhood 
- Roughly `n=3500` English speakers (*control*) and `n=500` Spanish speakers (*exposure*)

## Phenotyping AF

- *Exploration* of identifying ECG features with TTN mutations. Key mutations to include... *TTN*, *FLNC*, *MYBPC3*, *SCN5A*, *LMNA*
- Of these WES (`n=305`), there are (`n=56`) with TTN variants (different mutations however)
- Over 1k ECGs associated with this cohort
- **Approach**: using ECG-based tensors, will trial multiple neural networks and see efficacy, but will require larger validation cohort
- Requires cluster computing &rarr; likely more cost-effective than purchasing our own hardware

```

K23 application in ~2.5 years, with following variables:

1. EP fellowship + faculty position institution
1. Department and divisional support
1. Changes / discoveries in research field/space

## Areas of interest {.smaller}

- Stress: arrhythmic component in abnormal stress reactions (autonomic-mediated)
- pAF: trajectory, phenotypes and subphenotypes
- ECG: beat segmentation, morphology, machine learning approaches 
- EPS: *novel* approaches to electrogram classification, 3D mapping analysis (conduction velocity, scar mapping)
- Genetic variants: GWAS for burden/progression, ECG-markers, cardiovagal receptors

## Research questions {.smaller}

Do certain phenotypes (EMR, ECG, TTE, VUS) that have different rate of progression of AF? 

Are there genetic variants in cardiovagal receptors that increase the risk of autonomic dysfunction to stress? 

Are markers of abnormal stress reactivity predictive of future arrhythmic events?

## Specific proposals {.smaller}

1. **ECG/PAF** = ECG classification of progression/trajectory of pAF (terminal P wave forces in NSR, coarseness of F waves in AF) *builds on DSP and EPI skills*
1. **GWAS/PAF** = GWAS with ECG markers of pAF trajectory in AF Registry, validate in ARIC (?)  to *develop skills in computational genetics*
1. **GWAS/ANS** = Exploratory association of genetic variants with "maladaptive ANS response" from Emory MIMS/MIPS dataset as *fundamental for ANS-mediated arrhythmias*
1. **COSINOR** = Circadian rhythm (multiphase) of HRV/ECG markers with neuropsychological stress (e.g. depression/anxiety) *builds on previous software publications*
1. **ECG/MSNA** = Correlation between SNA and ECG parameters (PRD, GEH, P-wave morphology) *strengthens DSP and clinical relevance*
1. **REVIEW** = Review of trigger-mediated versus scar-mediated pAF

## Specific Aims

The following aims will be supported by preliminary and published data generated from this research year, combining DSP, epidemiology, and genetic approaches. Expect some fluctuation as the research evolves.

1. Identify ECG-based phenotypes of pAF
1. Determine cardiovagal biomarker patterns of sympathetically-mediated pAF during EPS
1. Evaluate role of genetic variants in pAF progression

## Parallel clinical training

1. Studying for general cardiology boards
1. 50% conference attendance (supplemented by research meetings)
1. 1/2 clinic per week
1. 1/2 day of EP lab per week
1. 2-3 weeks of clinical service in spring prior to fellowship

## Milestone feedback

- [ ] Establish milestones that are appropriate for next 12 months of dedicated research
- [ ] Frequency and purpose of mentorship meetings
- [ ] Role of clinical training in this research year (e.g. EP lab, consults) 
- [ ] Importance of research skill development
- [ ] Mininum number of publications 

# 06/20/23 | AJS

## HRV/CVD revisions

- Better define baseline ANS dysfunction and stress-induced ANS inflexibility
- Consider moving HF HRV from supplement to main tables as they are similar in significance
- Methods confusion about sensitivity analyses

# 06/16/23 | AB

## Premises {.smaller}

1. Atrial fibrillation is a macro-reentry rhythm predominantly initiated by triggered electrical activity
1. Triggered activity can come from maladaptive autonomic tone &pm; focal scar &pm; tissue heterogeneity
1. Each triggered activation may not lead to a sustained or measurable episode of AF
1. Duration of AF is mediated by amount of fibrosis or *scar* available to sustain arrhythmia

[Hypothesis]{.underline}: Sympathetic activity **drives triggered atrial activity** that **leads to** and **sustains** episodes of AF in those with **structurally normal atria**

## Available Data {.smaller}

- ~145k patients with CVD diagnoses (overly sensitive)
- ~500k digital ECGs from 2010 to 2023
- Clinical notes from providers + support staff
- Procedure reports for cardiac studies (catheterization, ablation, device interrogation, echocardiography, cardioversion)

[Goals]{.underline}: Identify patients at **onset** of paroxysmal AF, and identify time point when burden of AF increases or transitions to **persistent** AF

::: aside
**Persistent AF** is poorly defined as >7 days of AF duration
:::

## Approach {.smaller}

1. Identify diagnosis of atrial fibrillation: ICD codes, ECG diagnoses
1. Confirm diagnoses: EP notes, interventions, hospitalizations, procedures
1. Quantify burden: documentation in notes, interventions, duration of episodes, change on repeat ECGs
1. Cross-sectional parameters:
	a. Clinical = weight, comorbidites
	a. Electrical = F-wave voltage, P-wave morphology, scar-burden on EPS
	a. Echocardiography = LA size/volume, LV size, LV function, diastology
	a. Treatment = PVI, ECV, antiarrhythmic drugs, BB
1. Evaluate trajectory: characteristics that associate with rapidity of diagnosis change

## NLP approach

- [ ] Filter clinical documentation to provider-only information
- [ ] NLP approach is to use bidirectional transformer approach (BERT) 
- [ ] Add fine-tuning layer with named entities for AF (symptoms/burden/recurrence)
- [ ] Compare with AF Registry as **training data**, and EMR as **test data**

# 06/13/23 | AJS {.smaller}

## Wrap up of HRV/CVD paper

- [x] Vaccarino feedback
- [ ] Quyyumi feedback
- [ ] Lampert feedback

## Zombie projects

- Circadian profile of depression, PTSD, anxiety
- Relationship of DYX with CAD burden (F32)
- CARRS ECG parameters and diabetes
- ECG-based age prediction and telomere length

## Aims-focused project 

1. &uarr; sympathetic activity + &darr; cardiovagal activity is malignant/maladaptive
1. Etiology of **vagolysis-prone** individuals is likely both *polygenic* + *acquired*
1. Phenotypes may show: abnormal variants in HRV-associated and cardiovagal-associated genes, abnormal ECG-markers or patterns (e.g. GEH), clinical covariates

[Question]{.underline}: Are there common/rare variants associated with these patients with higher risk (or is this a truly acquired disease)?
