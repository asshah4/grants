# Background

Paroxysmal AF contains a broad spectrum of disease, regardless of burden, frequency, hemodynamic or vascular complications, or etiology.
Several attempts have been made at pursuing more salient models, however they combine both paroxysmal and persistent AF into a binary diagnosis.
Two recent studies have documented 4 potential clusters may exist [@Pastori2020; @Vitolo2021]:

1.  Younger, lower comorbidities
1.  High CV risk factors
1.  High CV comorbidities
1.  High rates of non-CV comorbidities (e.g. cancer)

@Wineinger2019 showed that in terms of duration and episodes of AF, there may be a *staccato* (short, frequent episodes) versus *legato* (long, infrequent) patterns to AF, however unknown about underlying clinical relevance.

In this proposal, I aim to phenotype paroxysmal AF into clinically-relevant subtypes. This serves as the basis for future work for evaluating differences in prognosis (including endocardial mapping patterns to recurrence).

# Approach

[Hypothesis]{.underline}: *Diagnoses of paroxysmal AF will segregate into clusters based on electrical, clinical, and structural cardiac properties.*

The overall approach will be to use high-dimensionality reduction techniques to create finite clusters that alllow for segregation based on mutliple vector-spaces. 
This approach also allows for future *multi-state modeling* and *survival* techniques based on "events" &rarr; ablation, cardioversion, medication intensification, changes in burden, cardiomyopathy, etc.

## Data

The data that is currently available to answer this is derived from three sources:

a. UIC Multi-Ethnic AF Registry: ~1800 patients with various classes of AF that have contributed blood sampling for genetic analysis
b. Clinical Data Warehouse: collected by the CCTS, houses Cerner and EPIC charts from 2010 onwards, including clinical notes, procedure notes, diagnoses, vitals, medications
c. MUSE: ECGs from ~2000s to today with full digital/raw signal (10 seconds x 8 leads)

## Key variables

The key variables that will be used are a combination of clinical, electrical, imaging that will allow for creation of multiple dimensions for analysis.

**Electrocardiography**

[Sinus]{.underline}

- P-wave indices: voltage, AUC, duration, dispersion, terminal forces
- Global parameters: PR interval, P/R amplitude ratio
- Rate: high-frequency HRV, HR
 
[AF]{.underline}

- Conduction properties: ventricular response, shortest/longest RR intervals 
- Atrial parameters: dominant frequency (Fourier multi-transform), F-wave relative voltage + ∆ voltage over time

**Clinical**

- Age, Sex, Race
- Weight + ∆ weight over time
- Comorbidities (HTN, DM, HLD, CHF, CAD)
- CHADS2VAS2C score
- ADHF and h/o CHF
- Anti-arrhythmic intensification (AAD, BB uptitration, cardioversion, ablation)
- Atrial arrhythmias + recurrence + burden of AF over time
- Blood pressure + ∆ over time
- HR and responsiveness of HR over time

**Echocardiography**

- Volumes: LA, RA, LV, LVIDD
- Pressures: RVSP, PA pressures
- Diastology: E/e' ratio, A wave duration/velocity, A wave reversal
- Function: LVEF, RVEF, LA strain

The three phases of this project involve data intake and wrangling/tidying, initial analyses, and finally, abstract/manuscript production. 
This is to be done in sequence for ECG data followed by clinical data, and finally imaging/procedure data. 

We will perform both supervised and unsupervised cluster analysis on the ECG parameters first in attempt to identify if patterns segregate. 
Subsequently will identify if clinical characteristics vary between groups.
