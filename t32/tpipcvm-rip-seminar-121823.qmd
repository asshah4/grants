- [Computational]{.green} & [digital signal processing]{.green} methods will be noted in [green]{.green}
- [Clinical data]{.red} that requires a physician or cardiologist to obtain are noted in [red]{.red}
- [Arrhythmia]{.yellow} and [electrical]{.yellow} focused work is noted in [yellow]{.yellow}

# Mechanism Classification

## Limitations in classification

## Basic arrhythmia mechanisms

- Triggered afterdepolarizations
- Enhaned automaticity
- Reentrant activity

## Differential contributions

- Spectrum between trigger-predominant and substrate-predominant
- Length of episodes of pAF (staccato v. legato)

# Substrate-Based Approaches

## Atrial myopathy

- Cardiac MRI
- TTE & TEE
- EPS data
- Utah Criteria

## Atrial size

- Boundaries
- Rotors

## Genetic influences on substrate

## [TTN variants]{.blue}

- TTN protein in the heart
- Relationship with AF
- Does it cause a myopathy?

## [Electrocardiography evaluation]{.green}

- Software for P wave detection
- Machine learning model

# [Autonomic Influences]{.yellow}

## Review of stress

- Stress and triggers of AF
- Neurocardiac pathways

## Non-PVI ablative strategies

## Neurocardiac axis

## Stress and arrhythmias

# Future Directions

## Novel approaches

## K23 aims
