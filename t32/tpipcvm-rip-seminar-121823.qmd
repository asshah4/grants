# Historical Context

## Atrial fibrillation overview

*A supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterized by uncoordinated atrial activation with subsequent deterioration of atrial mechanical function*

- Most common sustained arrhythmia in adults
- ~40% develop AF after age of 55 years
- Risk factors include: age, CAD, male sex, European ancestry, hypertension, obesity, smoking, sleep apnea, family history of AF in relatives
- 20% of new diagnoses are secondary to acute precipitant (e.g. surgery, pneumonia)

![The progression after developing AF can be cyclical, such that __AF begets AF__, adapted from @Rivner2020](../figures/rivner-2020-af-begets-af.png){#fig-af-begets-af}

---

![@Packer2020 describes how AF can be preceded by atrial myopathy, predominantly seen with enlarged left atria due to atrial mechanical dysfunction.](../figures/packer-2020-atrial-myopathy.png){#fig-atrial-myopathy}

## Comparative physiology

- Larger atria are seen in larger mammals, such as elephants and whales
- Prevalence of AF is not consistently associated with atrial size
- Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac abnormality in horses [@Decloedt2020], but rare in underwater mammals
- Atrial arrhythmias in aquatic mammals are related to diving (baroreceptor and diving reflexes) [@Williams2015]

*Is there more to atrial fibrillation than atrial size?*

## Arrhythmia mechanisms

*Multiple mechanisms are at play in AF simultaneously in AF, and may manifest in a similar fashion.*

@Antzelevitch2011:

- Re-entry *functionally* or around scar/fibrosis
- Local firing due to increased/enhanced automaticity
- Triggered activity due to early or delayed afterdepolarizations

## Differential contributions {.smaller}

- Spectrum between trigger-predominant and substrate-predominant
- Length of episodes of AF are related to both triggers and substrate
	- *Staccato* subtypes are short and frequent, but predominantly in lower-burden patients
	- *Legato* subtypes are long and infrequent, but predominantly in higher-burden patients
- Underlying mechanism of arrhythmia likely vary between these types in terms of **onset** and **maintenance** of arrhythmia

---

![Atrial fibrillation burden and episode duration are distinct, and subtypes exist. *Legato* is in upper left, and *staccato* is in lower right. Adapted from @Wineinger2019](../figures/wineinger-2019-paf-duration-subtypes.png){#fig-paf-duration-subtypes}

# Substrate Considerations

## Fibrosis and scar

- AF is sustained predominantly through [re-entry mechanisms]{.yellow}
- Scar and low-voltage areas become regions for functional re-entry
- Therapeutic strategies have targeted limiting the available area for re-entry to occur [@Calkins2017]
	- Catheter ablation, with 60-90% 1-year AF-free survival 
	- Surgical maze procedure, with 80% success

---

![Clinically, low-voltage areas, potential surrogates for scar and fibrosis, can be visualized during electrophysiology studies.](../figures/goldberger-2015-la-voltage-map.png)

---

![Low voltage areas can be quantified via MRI, such as by the Utah Criteria (@Mahnkopf2010)](../figures/mahnkopf-2010-utah-criteria.png){#fig-utah-criteria}

## Genetic influences on substrate {.tiny}

- A modifier of cardiac substrate are genetic variants
- @Choi2018 identified TTN loss-of-function variants and early-onset AF (most commonly associated genetic variation with AF)
- Manifestation of atrial fibrillation occurs through [atrial myopathy]{.red}, which may be identified through different imaging modalities including [ECG]{.green} [@Verweij2020]

[__Project__]{.underline}: Using the *TTN* gene as a case study, ECG features can be extracted that classify and [identify samples with deleterious variants]{.underline}, based on *in silico predictors* (PolyPhen, SIFT, REVEL), in a population with AF.]

## ECG prediction of pathogenic TTN variants {.smaller}

[Background]{.underline}: VUS/LP/P TTN variants are associated with increased incidence of EOAF. The mechanism is not fully understood. 

[Aims]{.underline}: Identify if VUS/LP/P TTN variants may cause structural atrial changes (an atrial myopathy) that is identifiable or ECG, or other related conduction changes. We [aim to identify if VUS/LP/P TTN variants can be classified on ECG using signal processing techniques]{.red}

[Approach]{.underline}: Utilize sinus rhythm ECGs from patients with WES/CGS with paroxysmal AF. Develop beat-by-beat algorithm to identify features that may be associated with VUS/LP/P TTN variants.

## ECG data {.smaller}

- `n = 298` patients were available and had ECG in sinus rhythm at some point from 2010 to 2023
- This amounted to `n = 7953` unique ECG that were thought to be in sinus rhythm
- Using a wavelet-decomposition approach, identified morphology of P wave, QRS complex, and T wave and created single-beat structures
- Using these `n = 51493` beats, there were `n = 6202` [cases]{.red} (which represents `n = 36` individuals with potential pathogenic TTN variants (based on SIFT/PolyPhen scores)
- Convoluted neural network approach to classify cases/controls

## Initial results

[Training]{.green}

- Training accuracy was `88%` with only `2%` loss after total of 10 steps

[Testing]{.green}

- Testing accuracy was `85%` with `13%` loss
- Example: single beat (control) may have a confidence of `75%` in being a control

## Next steps

1. Evaluate model-explainability (e.g. how heavily P-wave morphology influences confidence)
1. Expand to additional genes associated with AF
1. Validate in a larger cohort
1. Correlate with intracardiac EGM findings

# [Autonomic Influences]{.yellow}

## Evolution of treatment {.smaller}

- @Haissaguerre1998 identified pulmonary vein triggers for AF (associated with AF approximately 50% of the time)
- @Pappone2004 identified ganglionic plexi as targets for AF ablation (34% of patients in the study had complete denervation, and had less AF recurrence)
- @Narayan2012 identified rotors as targets for AF ablation (rotors were identified in 98% of patients, and 86% of patients had AF termination)
- @Baez-Escudero2014 found parasympathetic denervation using alcohol infusion into the Vein of Marshall led to decreased AF burden
- GANGLIA-AF, paroxysmal AF randomized to PVI or atrial GP ablation, decreased AAD dosages in GP group, n = 102 [@Kim2022]

*Pulmonary vein isolation is a component to the treatment of AF, but additional pathways exist that have still need to be explored.*

## Neurocardiac axis {.smaller}

- Neurocardiac axis is a hierarchical system of SNS and PNS afferent/efferent circuits that interact at multiple levels [@Armour1997]
	- Cortex &harr; brainstem
	- Spinal cord &harr; extracardiac ganglia (e.g. stellate)
	- Intrinsic cardiac nervous system (ICNS) &harr; heart
- Autonomic regulation is critical in the development of most CV disease
	- Disregulated catecholamines in heart failure
	- Post myocardial infarct VF
	- Triggered arrhythmias such as VT

![Cardiac neurotransmission @Shivkumar2016a](../figures/shivkumar-2022_neurocardiac-axis.png){#fig-neurocardiac-axis}

---

- **Lower levels** of networked structures (ICNS, hypothalamus) integrate afferent information about metabolic demands
- **Higher levels** of networked structures (amydala, cortex) integrate lower networks and generate conscious/unconscious CV state representations
- Allows for environmental/psychological factors to interplay with cardiac physiology, e.g. [mental stress]{.red} causing [arrhythmia]{.orange}

## Perturbations to the ANS {.smaller}

__Chronic mental stress__:

- Inflammatory mechanisms [@Hammadah2018a; @Pollitt2008]
- Autonomic mechanisms [@Carney2005; @Huang2018; @Penninx2017; @Smolderen2017]
- Associated with many changes to cardiac physiology [@Strike2003]

__Acute mental stress__:

- Peripheral vasoconstriction [@Kim2019; @Lima2019]
- Coronary vasomotion [@Hammadah2018b]
- Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia [@Vaccarino2021a], as seen in @fig-msimi-km-curves

![We found more so that ANS dysfunction due to mental stress increased the risk of CVD mortality from *arrhythmic etiology* by 5-fold (under review).](../figures/shah-2023-ehj-structured-abstract.png)

## Sympathovagal crosstalk {.smaller}

- Arrhythmia thresholds affected by sympathetic and vagal activity 
- Intracardiac cross-talk between adrenergic (sympathetic) and cholinergic (vagal) neurons in the hierarchy of neurocardiac axis is critical for arrhythmogenesis during mental stress
- Atria are heavily innervated by autonomic ganglionic plexi, leading to the complex activity that regulates cardiac conductive properties [@Hoover2009; @Armour1997] 

## Molecular mechanisms {.smaller}

- Sympathetic/adreneric neurons release catecholamines (NE) that directly affect the myocardium
- NPY and galanin is also released, which both inhibit cholinergic activity [@Herring2015a; @Herring2012]
- Both inhibit firing and leading to vagolytic effects on the myocardium[@Kalla2020; @Herring2008]
	- Galanin released as a adrenergic co-transmitter, binding to GalR1 receptors
	- NPY binds to cholinergic neurons through the Y2 receptor
	- Both directly/indirectly involve protein kinase C
- NPY receptors exist along the neurocardiac axis, including adrenal medulla (Y3) and cardiac tissue (Y2)[@Coote2013]

__EPS__:

- [We propose to evaluate mental stress directly during EPS to determine *adrenergic* and *vagal* contributions to AF initiation]{.red}
	- @Narayan2011 found that action potential duration (APD) alternans preceding the onset of AF during EP studies
	- Mental stress is associated with AF [@Lampert2014; @Lampert2019]

__Genetics__:

- Genetic variants associated with AF that are presented in candidate genes that effect autonomic regulation
- Polygenic risk score and/or mendelian randomization approach to identify those with mental stress-induced autonomic dysfunction
