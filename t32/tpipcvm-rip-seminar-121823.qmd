# Historical Context

## Atrial fibrillation overview {.smaller}

*A supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterized by uncoordinated atrial activation with subsequent deterioration of atrial mechanical function*

- Most common sustained arrhythmia in adults
- ~40% develop AF after age of 55 years [@Michaud2021]
- Risk factors include: age, CAD, male sex, European ancestry, hypertension, obesity, smoking, sleep apnea, family history of AF in relatives
- 20% of new diagnoses are secondary to acute precipitant (e.g. surgery, pneumonia)

## Comparative physiology {.smaller}

- Larger atria are seen in larger mammals, such as elephants and whales, proportional to allometric scaling (@fig-comparative-av-conduction)
- Prevalence of AF is not consistently associated with atrial size, e.g. @fig-whale-signal-averaged-ecg
- Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac abnormality in horses [@Decloedt2020], but rare in underwater mammals
- Atrial arrhythmias in aquatic mammals are related to diving (baroreceptor and diving reflexes), shown in @fig-diving-arrhythmias [@Williams2015]

*Is there more to atrial fibrillation than atrial size?*

## Arrhythmia mechanisms

*Multiple mechanisms are at play in AF simultaneously in AF, and may manifest in a similar fashion.*

@Antzelevitch2011:

- Re-entry *functionally* or around scar/fibrosis
- Local firing due to increased/enhanced automaticity
- Triggered activity due to early or delayed afterdepolarizations

## Differential contributions {.smaller}

- Spectrum between trigger-predominant and substrate-predominant
- Length of episodes of AF are related to both triggers and substrate
	- *Staccato* subtypes are short and frequent, but predominantly in lower-burden patients
	- *Legato* subtypes are long and infrequent, but predominantly in higher-burden patients
- Underlying mechanism of arrhythmia likely vary between these types in terms of **onset** and **maintenance** of arrhythmia

# Substrate Considerations

## Fibrosis and scar

- AF is sustained predominantly through [re-entry mechanisms]{.yellow}
- Scar and low-voltage areas become regions for functional re-entry
- Therapeutic strategies have targeted limiting the available area for re-entry to occur [@Calkins2017]
	- Catheter ablation, with 60-90% 1-year AF-free survival 
	- Surgical maze procedure, with 80% success

## Genetic influences on substrate

- A modifier of cardiac substrate are genetic variants
- @Choi2018 identified TTN loss-of-function variants and early-onset AF (most commonly associated genetic variation with AF)
- Manifestation of atrial fibrillation occurs through [atrial myopathy]{.red}, which may be identified through different imaging modalities including [ECG]{.green} [@Verweij2020]


## ECG prediction of TTN variants {.smaller background-color='#196774'}

[__Background__]{.underline}: VUS/LP/P TTN variants may cause structural atrial changes (an atrial myopathy) and/or conduction changes. 

[__Proposal__]{.underline}: Using the *TTN* gene as a case study, ECG features can be extracted that classify and [identify samples with deleterious variants]{.underline}, based on *in silico predictors* (PolyPhen, SIFT, REVEL), in a population with AF.

[__Approach__]{.underline}: Utilize sinus rhythm ECGs from patients with WES/CGS with paroxysmal AF. Develop beat-by-beat algorithm to identify features that may be associated with VUS/LP/P TTN variants.

## ECG data {.smaller}

- `n = 298` patients were available and had ECG in sinus rhythm at some point from 2010 to 2023
- This amounted to `n = 7953` unique ECG that were thought to be in sinus rhythm
- Using a wavelet-decomposition approach, identified morphology of P wave, QRS complex, and T wave and created single-beat structures
- Using these `n = 51493` beats, there were `n = 6202` [cases]{.red} (which represents `n = 36` individuals with potential pathogenic TTN variants (based on SIFT/PolyPhen scores)
- Convoluted neural network approach to classify cases/controls

1. Expand to additional genes associated with AF
1. Validate in a larger cohort
1. Correlate with intracardiac EGM and EAM findings

# Autonomic Influences

## Neurocardiac axis {.smaller}

- Neurocardiac axis is a hierarchical system of SNS and PNS afferent/efferent circuits that interact at multiple levels [@Armour1997]
	- Cortex &harr; brainstem
	- Spinal cord &harr; extracardiac ganglia (e.g. stellate)
	- Intrinsic cardiac nervous system (ICNS) &harr; heart
- Autonomic regulation is critical in the development of most CV disease
	- Dysregulated catecholamines in heart failure
	- Post myocardial infarct VF
	- Triggered arrhythmias such as VT
	
---

![Cardiac neurotransmission @Shivkumar2016a](../figures/shivkumar-2022_neurocardiac-axis.png){#fig-neurocardiac-axis}

---

- **Lower levels** of networked structures (ICNS, hypothalamus) integrate afferent information about metabolic demands
- **Higher levels** of networked structures (amydala, cortex) integrate lower networks and generate conscious/unconscious CV state representations
- Allows for environmental/psychological factors to interplay with cardiac physiology, e.g. [mental stress]{.red} causing [arrhythmia]{.orange}

## Evolution of treatment {.smaller}

- @Haissaguerre1998 identified pulmonary vein triggers for AF (associated with AF approximately 50% of the time)
- @Pappone2004 identified ganglionic plexi as targets for AF ablation (34% of patients in the study had complete denervation, and had less AF recurrence)
- @Narayan2012 identified rotors as targets for AF ablation (rotors were identified in 98% of patients, and 86% of patients had AF termination)
- @Baez-Escudero2014 found parasympathetic denervation using alcohol infusion into the Vein of Marshall led to decreased AF burden
- GANGLIA-AF, paroxysmal AF randomized to PVI or atrial GP ablation, decreased AAD dosages in GP group, n = 102 [@Kim2022]

*[Pulmonary vein isolation]{.red} is a component to the treatment of AF, but additional pathways exist that have need to be explored.*

## Perturbations to the ANS {.smaller}

__Chronic mental stress__:

- Inflammatory mechanisms [@Hammadah2018a; @Pollitt2008]
- Autonomic mechanisms [@Carney2005; @Huang2018; @Penninx2017; @Smolderen2017]
- Associated with many changes to cardiac physiology [@Strike2003]

__Acute mental stress__:

- Peripheral vasoconstriction [@Kim2019; @Lima2019]
- Coronary vasomotion [@Hammadah2018b]
- Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia [@Vaccarino2021a], as seen in @fig-msimi-km-curves

![@Vaccarino2021a published in JAMA the relationship between mental-stress induced myocardial ischemia and CVD mortality](../figures/vaccarino-2021-msimi-survival-curves.png){#fig-msimi-km-curves}

## {background-color='#0a3d72'}

![Shah et al. 2023 (*under review*) found that ANS dysfunction due to mental stress increased the risk of CVD mortality from *arrhythmic etiology*, e.g. VT/VF, by 5-fold.](../figures/shah-2023-ehj-structured-abstract.png)

## Sympathovagal crosstalk {.tiny}

- Atria are heavily innervated by autonomic ganglionic plexi, leading to the complex activity that regulates cardiac conductive properties [@Hoover2009; @Armour1997] 
- Intracardiac cross-talk between adrenergic (sympathetic) and cholinergic (vagal) neurons in the hierarchy of neurocardiac axis is critical for arrhythmogenesis during stress
- Sympathetic/adrenergic neurons release catecholamines (NE) that directly affect the myocardium
- NPY and galanin is also released, which both inhibit cholinergic activity and lead to vagolytic effects [@Kalla2020; @Herring2008; @Herring2015a; @Herring2012]
	- Galanin released as a adrenergic co-transmitter, binding to GalR1 receptors
	- NPY binds to cholinergic neurons through the Y2 receptor
- NPY receptors exist along the neurocardiac axis, including adrenal medulla (Y3) and cardiac tissue (Y2) [@Coote2013]

---

![Increased sympathetic activity and NPY @Hoang2020](../figures/hoang-2020-npy-blockade.png){#fig-npy-blockade}

## Action potential duration {.smaller}

@Narayan2011 found that prior to the onset of atrial fibrillation, APD alternans occurred, measured through a monophasic action potential catheter (in humans). 

- Pulmonary veins have higher resting membrane potential, lower amplitude of action potential, and shortened APD
- Premature beats or pulmonary vein triggers likely automatic or triggered related to calcium handling abnormalities
- [Electrical remodeling]{.yellow} alters ion expression, reducing inward $Ca^{2+}$ currents and enhances inward $K^{+}$ currents, leading to shorter APD (stabilizing reentrant circuits in AF)

---

![@Winter2018 showed changes in APD and $Ca^{2+}$ transient alternans using SNS stimulation. Notably, there was a decreased in APD threshold and alternans.](../figures/winter-2018-sns-calcium-transient-alternans.png){#fig-sns-calcium-transient-alternans}

---

![@Winter2018 further showed that the APD alternans due to SNS stimulation was additive to decreased cycle lengths. *Thus, the threshold for alternans occurs at faster rates during adrenergic stimulation.*](../figures/winter-2018-noradrenaline-apd-alternans.png){#fig-noradrenaline-apd-alternans}

## Vagal effects on APD

- Primarily mediated through $I_{KACh}$
	- Cholinergic (vagal) leads to reduction in APD
	- Activation of $I_{KACh}$ occurs during depolarized phases of action potential
- However, acetylcholine is short-lived
	- Rapidly degraded by acetylcholinesterase 
	- Leads to substantial localization of acetylcholine effects $\rightarrow$ [spatial heterogeneity]{.yellow}
	
## Mental stress and atrial arrhythmias {.smaller background-color='#9b2226'}

[__Background__]{.underline}: Mental stress is associated with AF [@Lampert2014; @Lampert2019]. Mental stress challenges capture both vagal and sympathetic branches of the ANS, which lead to specific electrical manifestations that allow for *onset* and *maintenance* of atrial arrhythmias. 

[__Proposal__]{.underline}: We propose to evaluate mental stress testing and manipulation of the intrinsic ANS to better understand onset and initiation of AF episodes, and contributions to its maintenance, in humans.

[__Approach__]{.underline}: Using a monophasic action potential mapping catheter, we will observe APD changes to extra-stimuli protocol during mental stress challenges, and during ANS modulating interventions (SNS and PNS stimulation and blockade) during EPS. APD alternans will be recorded and subsequently analyzed.
