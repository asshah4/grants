__Analysis__

- Genetic analysis in PLINK complete
- Models are set up for analysis once data intake is done
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
__Status__

1. Have n = 238 currently
1. Reviewed 95 charts thus far (CAR team)
1. Of n = 108, 75 have had recurrence, 33 without (rate of about 70% of anyarrhythmia)
1. Of ECG based confirmation, 43 AF recurrence events (53%)

## AF Registry {.smaller}

REDCap data dictionary is finalized. Next steps are:

1. Data entry for outcomes
2. Finalization of new patients to add from AF ablation registry

## Genetics {.smaller}

Currently able to:

- Format large SNP data sets into appropriate tables
- Utilize `PLINK` and `MERLIN` to process Chen's genetics data
- Run from R to help analyze findings

Next steps:

- Confirm ancestry (for practice) percent likelihood 
- Then, once outcome data is complete, analyze differences by race

Analytical methods:

- Time to binary outcome of recurrence
- Recurrent event analysis for AF recurrence
- Can revise with Bayesian modeling in `STAN` as well

## AF Registry

Consider additional variables:

- Recurrent events and adjudication (HF, cardiac admission, MACE)
- Holter/ECG data and repeat collection (P-wave morphology, Wilson's vector gradient, amplitude of AF waves "coarseness")

Will check with the MESA and ARIC data base on how repeat events were defined.

## AF Registry

The AF registry is described [here](https://asshah4.github.io/aflubber). Current issues:

1. Data quality - consistency between reviewers
1. Missingness - decisions on acceptable thresholds
1. Variable selection - echo findings, EP studies, medications, labs, symptoms
1. Management - REDCap, shared excel sheet
1. Adjudication/review - outcomes, clinical follow-up length
