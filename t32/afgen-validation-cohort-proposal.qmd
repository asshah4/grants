AF is a multifactorial disease that is both highly prevalent and burdensome, with a lifetime incidence of 1 out of 3-4 individuals.
Although We have a limited understanding of the clinical factors that lead to atrial fibrillation (__AF__) pathogenesis, there is growing evidence of the genetic underpinnings of AF [@Weng2020; @Choi2020].
It is clear that AF maintenance and pro-generation are a property of the atrial substrate, which can likely be further phenotyped based on how the atria are remodeled.
The relationship of the atrial substrate to underlying genetic factors has somewhat been seen in studies evaluating electrocardiogram (ECG) associations with genetic variants [@Verweij2020; @Weng2020; @Holmqvist2015; @Husser2009; @Choi2021].
In this proposal, I plan to correlate the genetic manifestations of AF with the electrical properties of through electrocardiographic (__ECG__) evaluation of atrial and ventricular depolarization and repolarization using a deep neural network (__DNN__).

Relevant work previously is primarily by @Verweij2020 and @vandeLeur2021, who have evaluated ECG relationships with genetic variants identified in whole exome sequencing data (**WES**) in the UK Biobank.
@Verweij2020 noted that specific temporal features of the ECG could be associated with genetic abnormalities (@fig-ecg-variants).
@vandeLeur2021 expanded on this to understand the electrical phenotype of a specific disease, in this case, phosphalamban cardiomyopathy, and demonstrated that a neural network could help identify morphological features of the ECG that were associated with the disease, best seen in @fig-ecg-dnn.
Additional work has been done that evaluates the polygenic risk score (PGS) for AF, which appears to be additive to that of monogenic risk for AF [@Khera2018; @Marston2023; @Choi2020].

Our proposal varies from the previous work as the goal is instead to evaluate the potential mechanisms of AF, instead of novel diagnosis of specific genetic variants.
By comparing ECG of individuals with known AF into specific endotypes based on genetic variants associated with their AF, we can understand how variants may lead to AF through electrophyioslogical manifestations.
As such, I have characterized genes putatively associated with cardiovascular disease into 4 categories:

1. Structural genes (e.g. TTN, PITX2, LMNA, NUP155, GJA1/5)
1. Ion channel genes (e.g. KCNE1-5, KCNQ1, SCN5A), subdivided by current type
1. Metabolic genes
1. Inflammatory genes

These categories, from a causal perspective, share mechanistic similarities in how they may lead to AF. 
To identify if electrophysiological manifestations exist, in a sample with documented paroxysmal AF, individuals that carry a loss-of-function (**LOF**) in one of the above gene categories, or they may be *wild-type* (no known deleterious AF-associated genes).
We will also look at the ECG-contribution to the PGS of AF, which has been shown to have independent associations with future AF risk [@Wang2023]. 
Instead of predicting AF, we will attempt to categorize the contributions to the PGS of AF based on 12-lead ECG.

We have completed a feasibility study using the *TTN* gene as a proof-of-concept, seen in @fig-shah-ttn, using a convolutional neural network with bidirectional memory. 
The model was trained on a cohort of `n=200` individuals with known paroxysmal AF, with `n=100` being reserved as a testing data set. 
Of those, using the strictest variant effect prediction definition for LOF, `n=4` individuals were considered as cases (roughly 2% of the cohort).
Each individual contributed 1 to 10 ECG, with each ECG being segmented into individual sinus beats, and each sinus beat used as a training (or test) data array. 
We had a sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 95%, with a balanced accuracy of 96% and detection prevalence of 95%. 

We aim to expand this project to better understand the electrocardiographyic phenotype of AF, to better understand mechanisms behind AF pathogenesis, and identify individuals at different degrees of risk for AF. My aims are as follow:

1. __Monogenic Aim__: Validate a DNN model to identify deleterious gene variants associated with AF in individuals with known AF, with cases defined as those with: a) sarcomeric or structural proteins, b) ion channel-related proteins, c) metabolic proteins, and d) inflammatory proteins that have a known association with cardiovascular disease. 
1. __Polygenic Aim__: Train a DNN model to assess the polygenic risk (PGS) of AF in individuals with known AF and dense SNP genotyping data, based on recent, validated AF-GWAS PGS [@Khera2018; @Marston2023]. The model would be trained to predict the percent PGS of AF, however the input is a 12-lead ECG.

We utilized participants from the UIC Multi-Ethnic AF Registry as the primary study population, who have a combination of WES and dense SNP genotyping data. This allowed me to generate a small DNN model for both monogenic and polygenic patterns. However, the sample size was small, reducing generalizability.
We propose to utilize a large, external cohort, such the UK Biobank (`n=68,091` with complete data), as well as additional populations with WES data available. 
Our work will be the next logical step in elucidating genetic mechanisms of AF, and provides a novel approach to understand biological endotypes of the disease.

![Our recent work is demonstrated here, where we identify ECGs that are associated with *TTN* LOF in individuals with AF. The *red* line indicates the median signal seen in cases, while the *blue* represents those that serve as controls (those with no known genetic variants in sarcomeric proteins). The yellow gradient activation notes the regions of the ECG that were most informative in differentiating *TTN* cases from controls. Notably, in this model, the repolarization phase is most strongly associated with *TTN* cases in AF.](../figures/shah-2024-ttn-ecg-association.png){#fig-shah-ttn}
