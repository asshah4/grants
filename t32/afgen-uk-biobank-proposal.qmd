- My proposal is to look at categorize the genetic phenotypes of AF by ECG
- ECG can be used to evaluate risk
- There are a number of studies that have looked at ECG and genetic risk
- Mine is the first to look at evaluating risk by category of variants
- Have evaluated in WES dataset of 300 patients
- ECG to predict the following parameters
	- Structural changes to atria
	- Ion channel remodeling
	- Global polygenic affects
- tentative title: __Electrocardiographic Signatures of Genetic Risk for Atrial Fibrillation__
- Potential data sources

- Current literature on ECG and genetic risk for AF
