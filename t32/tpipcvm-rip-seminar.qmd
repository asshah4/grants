## {.smaller}

__Hypothesis__: In humans with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, during episodes of increased sympathetic outflow, _inappropriate or disproportionate vagal withdrawal (vagolysis) leads to arrhythmogenesis._

. . .

::: {.incremental}
a. Changes in electrical activity precede the onset of arrhythmias 
a. Arrhythmia onset requires both a structurally-susceptible heart and a trigger
a. Triggers effect the electrical microcosm of the heart through autonomic outflows/imbalance
:::

. . .

The concept of vagolysis and arrhythmogenesis will be referred to as __vagal-triggered arrhythmias (VTA)__ hereafter.

# Relationship between ANS and cardiac physiology

## Neurocardiac axis {.smaller}

- Neurocardiac axis is a hierarchical system of SNS and PNS afferent/efferent circuits that interact at multiple levels [@Armour1997]
	- Cortex &harr; brainstem
	- Spinal cord &harr; extracardiac ganglia (e.g. stellate)
	- Intrinsic cardiac nervous system (ICNS) &harr; heart
- Autonomic regulation is critical in the development of most CV disease
	- Disregulated catecholamines in heart failure
	- Post myocardial infarct VF
	- Triggered arrhythmias such as VT
	
---

![Cardiac neurotransmission @Shivkumar2016a](../figures/shivkumar-2022_neurocardiac-axis.png){#fig-neurocardiac-axis}

---

- **Lower levels** of networked structures (ICNS, hypothalamus) integrate afferent information about metabolic demands
- **Higher levels** of networked structures (amydala, cortex) integrate lower networks and generate conscious/unconscious CV state representations
- Allows for environmental/psychological factors to interplay with cardiac physiology, e.g. [mental stress]{.red} causing [arrhythmia]{.orange}

## Assessment of the ANS

- Sympathogal balance integrate at the heart, as seen in @fig-sns-pns-heart
- HRV serves a surrogate for autonomic function
- Variability occurs due to sympathovagal balance at level of sinoatrial node
- Sympathetic outflow and vagal outflow occur at difference _speeds_ allowing some level of differentiation

## Autonomic function and coronary physiology

A study in veteran twins:

- Evaluated 24-hour HRV in controlled setting/scheduled
- Evaluated quantitative myocardial perfusion imaging
- Compared circadian patterns of HRV with coronary flow reserves

HRV can be [processed]{.green} through open-source software[@Vest2018]

---

__Summary__: HRV seems to correlate with clinically relevant ANS influences on the heart

- ANS function varies with circadian rhythm[@Portaluppi2012]
- Decrease HRV responsiveness to the _morning surge_ suggests dysfunction above the level of the heart
- Decreased ANS variability also correlates with myocardial ischemia (particularly coronary flow reserve), which is partially mediated through adrenergic tone[@DelBuono2021]

__Summary__: Stress seems to increase risk of CV mortality, through autonomic mechanisms (as compared to ischemic)

- Autonomic dysfunction correlates with future CV mortality[@LaRovere1998]
- HRV seems to be associated with clinically features of CV mortality
- Acute stress seems to be of particular importance

# Determine clinical impact of vagal withdrawal

## Critical role of the vagus {.smaller}

- Embryologically, vagus nerve sprouts from medulla and extends to distant organs (thus long pre-ganglionic axons) e.g. heart, lung, intestines
- Parasympathetic control is evolutionarily more primitive in vertebrates, pre-dating sympathetic control
	- Sharks exhibit phasic HRV without sympathetic innervation [@Taylor2022]
	- Mammalian vagal control is more complex, with multiple nuclei, e.g. polyvagal [@Porges2009]
- Mammalian vagal outflow is particularly coupled with cardiorespiratory control
	- Leads to [respiratory sinus arrhythmia]{.orange}
	- Respiratory changes occur at a high-frequency, can be [measured by HRV]{.green}
	
## Vagal therapeutic interventions {.smaller}

- Chronic VNS reduces drop in ejection fraction in different animal models of cardiomyopathy, including MI, but studies have mixed results in humans
	- NECTAR-HF ~ VNS or sham, no difference at 6 months in LV size/function, n = 96
	- INOVATE-HF ~ right VNS + GDMT vs. GDMT, no difference in mortality, n = 700
	- ANTHEM-HF ~ non-randomized VNS, improved LV function, pilot study (*required titrated VNS to cause decrease in HR*)
- VNS may be anti-arrhythmic in animal models, with decreased VT/VF, but minimal human studies
	- GANGLIA-AF, paroxysmal AF randomized to PVI or atrial GP ablation, decreased AAD dosages in GP group, n = 102

![Resting HF and HF reactivity as additive markers of CV mortality](../figures/hf-hrv-reactivity-km-curves.png){#fig-hf-reactivity-curve.png}
	
## Jacksonian dissolution

Jacksonian dissolution is the concept that older, more primitive systems will take over when more evolved systems break down. Polyvagal theory (theorized by Porges)[@Porges2007] posits there are two branches of the vagus nerve

1. _Reptilian vagus_: primitive, unmyelinated, controlled by the dorssal motor nucleus
1. _Mammalian vagus_: evolved, myelinated, controlled by teh nucleus ambiguus

This may explain the additive effect of reduced resting HF HRV and reduced HF HRV reactivity

# Identify a representative disease model = paroxysmal AF

## Sympathovagal crosstalk {.smaller}

- Arrhythmia thresholds affected by sympathetic and vagal activity 
- Intracardiac cross-talk between adrenergic (sympathetic) and cholinergic (vagal) neurons in the hierarchy of neurocardiac axis is critical for arrhythmogenesis during mental stress
- Atria are heavily innervated by autonomic ganglionic plexi, leading to the complex activity that regulates cardiac conductive properties[@Hoover2009; @Armour1997] 
- Sympathetic nervous activity is slower onset, but vagolysis is rapid, thus being a more likely causal component of arrhythmogenesis

## Molecular mechanisms {.smaller}

- Sympathetic/adreneric neurons release catecholamines (NE) that directly affect the myocardium
- NPY and galanin is also released, which both inhibit cholinergic activity [@Herring2015; @Herring2012]
- Both inhibit firing and leading to vagolytic effects on the myocardium[@Kalla2020; @Herring2008]
	- Galanin released as a adrenergic co-transmitter, binding to GalR1 receptors
	- NPY binds to cholinergic neurons through the Y2 receptor
	- Both directly/indirectly involve protein kinase C
- NPY receptors exist along the neurocardiac axis, including adrenal medulla (Y3) and cardiac tissue (Y2)[@Coote2013]

## Genetic variants

| Variant | Description |
| - | --- |
| rs16147 | NPY promoter region | 
| rs10842383 | LINC00477, HF HRV |
| rs236349 | PPIL1, RMSSD |
| rs4262 | GNG11, SDNN |
| rs7980799 | SYT10, respiratory sinus arrhythmia |
| rs12974991 | NDUFA11, HF HRV |

## Inadequate classification

- pAF has been separated into coarse, non-physiological groups (paroxysmal, persistent, permanent)
- Diagnostic and treatment strategies are overally-generalized, and do not identify or target sub-phenotypes or endo-phenotypes that may exist
	- e.g. vagally-mediated AF responds well to disopyramide
- Attempts to re-classify/cluster AF have been performed,[@Watanabe2021; Vitolo2021; @Pastori2020] and generally suggest 4 broad categories:
	1. Young, low risk
	1. High CV risk factors
	1. High comorbid CV disease
	1. High comorbid non-CV disease
	
_However, these categories are skewed, with the younger, low-risk group being >50% of the samples._

## pAF as a model for VTA

1. pAF is both ubiquitous and poorly-classified
1. Mechanism-driven therapies may exist for [sub-phenotypes and endo-phenotypes]{.blue}
1. [Autonomic triggers]{.orange} associated with atrial arrhythmias
1. Functional/anatomical relationship between atria and GP exist
1. [Electrophysiology studies]{.red} are readily avaiable, with rich [electrical signal data]{.green}, for analysis in humans
1. [Genetic variants]{.blue} lead to cardiomyocyte changes that predispose to AF, but there are also variants that affect cardiovagal outflow

## Research approach {.smaller}

1. Identify within [pAF]{.orange} if there exist VTA __sub-phenotypes__ using [population-level]{.blue} data:
	- Clinical comorbidities
	- Arrhythmia burden
	- Psychosocial stressors 
	- Ischemic and structural heart disease
	- Cardiomyopathy (atrial and ventricular)
1. Identify in individuals undergoing ablative therapy for pAF if there exist patterns that support a VTA __endo-phenotype__ using intracardiac data:
	- Electrophysiology properties of AF (dominant frequencies, pulmonary vein triggers, scar burden, atrial volume)
	- Intracardiac biomarkers of vagolysis (both electrical and neurohormonal)
	- Genetic variants that may be susceptible to abnormal cardiovagal outflow

## Aim #1: Clinical {.smaller}

1. __Identify clinical phenotypes of vagally-triggered AF.__
_Clinical, intracardiac, and genetic factors will contribute to clinically-relevant phenotypes of AF_.
	a. We will [develop a pragmatic, population-level dataset]{.blue} to abstract clinical risk factors, ECG, and echocardiography features and therapy responses. [Using unsupervised learning models]{.green}, AF will be classified into seperate clusters.
	a. The [clinical relevance of AF phenotypes]{.red} will be assessed through relevant outcomes (adverse events, disease burden/progression). AF clusters identified in __1a__ will have distinct hazard distributions [estimated through survival analysis]{.green}.

## Aim #2: Translational {.smaller}

2. __Determine the intracardiac characteristics of vagally-triggered AF.__
_Structural and electrical features assessed through EPS will identify separate clinically-relevant phenotypes of AF._
	a. We will collect electroanatomical mapping data and electrogram recordings [during PVI]{.red} of paroxysmal AF. Using [signal processing and feature reduction]{.green}, we will identify clusters of structural and electrical AF that correlate with those identified in __1a__. 
	a. We will apply physiological stress [through catecholamine infusion]{.red}, respectively. Catecholamine infusion will lead to [&uarr;NE, &uarr;NPY, &uarr;Gal expression]{.orange} while mental stress will lead to [&uarr;NE, &uarr;NPY, &uarr;Gal expression]{.orange} 
	a. In those with suspected vagally-triggered AF, there will be an increased risk of [Y2R and Gal1R receptor polymorphisms]{.orange}.
	a. We will perform [whole exome sequencing]{.orange} on a subset of patients from each cluster defined in __1a__. Selected $\alpha$ and $\beta$ adrenergic receptors and cholinergic receptor polymorphisms will be associated with individual AF clusters and clinical outcomes.
