# Background

## Autonomic control of the heart {.smaller}

- Neurocardiac axis is a hierarchical system of SNS and PNS afferent/efferent circuits that interact at multiple levels [@Armour1997]
	- Cortex &harr; brainstem
	- Spinal cord &harr; extracardiac ganglia (e.g. stellate)
	- Intrinsic cardiac nervous system (ICNS) &harr; heart
- Autonomic regulation is critical in the development of most CV disease
	- Disregulated catecholamines in heart failure
	- Post myocardial infarct VF
	- Triggered arrhythmias such as VT

::: aside
SNS = sympathetic nervous system;
PNS = parasympathetic nervous system;
:::

---

![Cardiac neurotransmission @Shivkumar2016a](../figures/shivkumar-2022_neurocardiac-axis.png){#fig-neurocardiac-axis}

## Neurovisceral integration

- **Lower levels** of networked structures (ICNS, hypothalamus) integrate afferent information about metabolic demands
- **Higher levels** of networked structures (amydala, cortex) integrate lower networks and generate conscious/uncscious CV state representations
- Allows for environmental/psychological factors to interplay with cardiac physiology, e.g. [mental stress]{.blue} causing [arrhythmia]{.orange}

## Critical role of the vagus {.smaller}

- Embryologically, vagus nerve sprouts from medulla and extends to distant organs (thus long pre-ganglionic axons) e.g. heart, lung, intestines
- Parasympathetic control is evolutionarily more primitive in vertebrates, preceeding sympathetic control
	- Sharks exhihibt phasic HRV without sympathetic innervation [@Taylor2022]
	- Mammalian vagal control is more complex, with multiple nuclei, e.g. polyvagal [@Porges2009]
- Mammalian vagal outflow is particularly coupled with cardiorespiratory control
	- Leads to [respiratory sinus arrhythmia]{.orange}
	- Respiratory changes occur at a high-frequency, can be [measured by HRV]{.green}

::: aside
Stephen Porges proposed the Polyvagal Theory during his tenure at UIC.
HRV = heart rate variability;
:::

## Vagal therapeutic interventions {.smaller}

- Chronic VNS reduces drop in ejection fraction in different animal models of cardiomyopathy, including MI, but studies have mixed results in humans
	- NECTAR-HF ~ VNS or sham, no difference at 6 months in LV size/function, n = 96
	- INOVATE-HF ~ right VNS + GDMT vs. GDMT, no difference in mortality, n = 700
	- ANTHEM-HF ~ non-randomized VNS, improved LV function, pilot study (*required titrated VNS to cause decrease in HR*)
- VNS may be anti-arrhythmic in animal models, with decreased VT/VF, but minimal human studies
	- GANGLIA-AF, paroxysmal AF randomized to PVI or atrial GP ablation, decreased AAD dosages in GP group, n = 102

::: aside
VNS = vagal nerve stimulation;
MI = myocardial infarction;
LV = left ventricle;
GP = ganglionated plexi;
AAD = anti-arrhythmic drugs
:::

## Sympathovagal crosstalk {.smaller}

- Arrhythmia thresholds affected by sympathetic and vagal activity 
- Intracardiac cross-talk between adrenergic (sympathetic) and cholinergic (vagal) neurons in the hierarchy of neurocardiac axis is critical for arrhythmogenesis during mental stress
- Atria are heavily innervated by autonomic ganglionic plexi, leading to the complex activity that regulates cardiac conductive properties[@Hoover2009; @Armour1997] 
- Sympathetic nervous activity is slower onset, but vagolysis is rapid, thus being a more likely causal component of arrhythmogenesis

## Molecular mechanisms {.smaller}

- Sympathetic/adreneric neurons release catecholamines (NE) that directly affect the myocardium
- NPY and galanin is also released, which both inhibit cholinergic activity [@Herring2015; @Herring2012]
- Both inhibit firing and leading to vagolytic effects on the myocardium[@Kalla2020; @Herring2008]
	- Galanin released as a adrenergic co-transmitter, binding to GalR1 receptors
	- NPY binds to cholinergic neurons through the Y2 receptor
	- Both directly/indirectly involve protein kinase C
- NPY receptors exist along the neurocardiac axis, including adrenal medulla (Y3) and cardiac tissue (Y2)[@Coote2013]

::: aside
NE = nor epinephrine;
NPY = neuropeptide Y

# Aims

## Aim #1: Clinical {.smaller}

1. __To identify clinical phenotypes of vagal-mediated paroxysmal AF.__
_Clusters of clinical features will identify AF that will correlate with differential responses to treatment strategies._
	a. Clinical history, disease progression, and surface/non-invasive cardiac imaging will [identify stable, novel clusters]{.green} of AF phenotypes in [population-level datasets]{.blue}
	a. [Intracardiac findings during EPS]{.red} will [identify stable, novel clusters]{.green} of AF phenotypes using a combination of [electroanatomical mapping and signal processing]{.green}.
	a. [Baseline serum levels of autonomic hormones (NE, NPY, Gal)]{.orange} will correlate with the burden and chronicity of AF. 
	a. Increased [arrhythmia burden and &uarr;NE, &uarr;NPY, &uarr;Gal]{.orange} will be associated with an increased risk of [genetic polymorphisms]{.blue} in candidate genes known to be expressed by cholinergic neurons (e.g. **rs16147**[@Chang2016])

::: aside
Variant **rs6147** expressed in promoter region of NPY and associated with increased perception of environmental stress.[@Chang2016]
EPS = electrophysiology study
:::

## Aim #2: Translational {.smaller}

1. __To evaluate the effect of modifying the intrinsic cardiac nervous system in the ablative treatment of vagal-mediated paroxysmal AF.__
_The burden and phenotype of AF will correlate with the expression of differential structural and autonomic biomarkers._
	a.  [Modification of the ICNS]{.red} through ablation during PVI, documented by the release of S100B,[@Mehra2022] will lead to [&darr;NE, &darr;NPY, &darr;Gal expression]{.orange} (as a marker of decreased vagal afferent activity).
	a. Increased sympathetic/adrenergic stress [through catecholamine infusion]{.red} will lead to [&uarr;NE, &uarr;NPY, &uarr;Gal expression]{.orange}. 
	a. Increased mental stress [through mental stress challenge]{.red} will lead to [&uarr;NE, &uarr;NPY, &uarr;Gal expression]{.orange} 
	a. [Atrial arrhythmia thresholds]{.orange} will be acutely decreased after GP ablation based on decreases in [electrical dispersion, triggered after-depolarizations, and HRV]{.green}.

::: aside
ANP/BNP = atrial/brain natriuretic peptide;
PVI = pulmonary vein isolation
:::

## Aim #3: Basic {.smaller}

3. __To assess the electrophysiological effects of autonomic hormones on _in vitro_ cardiac tissue.__
_The increase in EAD seen in atrial cardiomyocytes due to vagolysis will be blunted by antagonism of NPY and Gal_.
