# 1) Vagolysis & Arrhythmias

## Background {.smaller}

__Mechanism__: The key mechanism to explore is intracardiac cross-talk between adrenergic (sympathetic) and cholinergic (vagal) neurons.
	
- Atria are heavily innervated by autonomic ganglionic plexi, leading to the complex activity that regulates cardiac conductive properties[@Hoover2009; @Armour1997] 
- Adrenergic neurons release catecholamines that directly affect the myocardium, but indirectly as well through neuropeptide Y (NPY)[@Coote2013]
- NPY binds to cholinergic neurons through the Y2 receptor, inhibiting firing and leading to vagolytic effects on the myocardium[@Kalla2020; @Herring2008]

1. **Explore the role of vagolysis in triggered arrhythmias.** 
	1a. Unopposed &uarr; SNA is arrhythmogeneic.
	1b. 
	

Hypothesis: arrhythmia thresholds will be reduced by blockade of vagolysis (as opposed to only adrenergic stimulation). 



## Methods

In a murine model of arrhythmia, I propose to study the characteristics of myocardial conduction properties (phase slope changes, after depolarizations, ectopy) in a series of experiments that modulate the sympathetic nervous system at the level of the myocardium. 
These models will be prepared as ex-vivo, vagal-sparing whole heart explants in Langendorf preparations. 
	
# 2) Arrhythmia Phenotypes

## Background {.invisible}

1. **Identify phenotypes of triggered arrhythmia.** Hypothesis: clinical phenotypes of atrial fibrillation exist that will classify increased burden of pulmonary vein triggers as measured by electrophysiology study.

Using several "big-data" cohorts apart from UIC, including ARIC, MESA, MVP, the VA Research Database, I will create computational models to classify atrial fibrillation phenotypes (based on clinical, ECG, and echocardiographic parameters). 
These classification clusters will be used to compare findings from intracardiac monitoring during EPS/PVI, such as LA geometry, atrial scar and voltage burden, dominant AF frequencies, ectopy, etc. 
This project remains a work-in-progress and will need further credentials, computational power, and signal processing efforts to realize.
