## Aims

1. Mechanism of mental stress on the risk of triggered atrial arrhythmia
1. Phenotypes of vagal-mediated atrial fibrillation
1. Genetic and/or molecular markers of vagolysis

# Mental Stress + Arrhythmias

## Background {.smaller}

__Mechanism__: intracardiac cross-talk between adrenergic (sympathetic) and cholinergic (vagal) neurons in the hierarchy of neurocardiac axis
	
- Atria are heavily innervated by autonomic ganglionic plexi, leading to the complex activity that regulates cardiac conductive properties[@Hoover2009; @Armour1997] 
- Adrenergic neurons release catecholamines that directly affect the myocardium, but indirectly as well through neuropeptide Y (NPY)[@Coote2013]
- NPY binds to cholinergic neurons through the Y2 receptor, inhibiting firing and leading to vagolytic effects on the myocardium[@Kalla2020; @Herring2008]

__Identify the effect of mental stress on vagolysis and triggered arrhythmias__

In participants that are undergoing electrophysiology studies, we will cause vagolysis and measure the effect on intracardiac conduction properties using mental stress induction, vagal nerve stimulation, and pharmacological methods.



## Methods {.smaller}


::: aside
NE = nor ephinephrine; NPY = neuropeptide Y; VNS = vagal nerve stimulation; Y2Ra = Y2 receptor antagonist

# 2. Arrhythmic Phenotypes

## Background {.smaller}

__Mechanism__: Triggered forms of arrhythmias, such as pulmonary vein triggers of atrial fibrillation, have different physiological and epidemiological characteristics forming unique phenotypes.

> TO BE DETERMINED

## Methods {.smaller}

1. Create cohort from "big data" 
	- UIC/CCTS
	- Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study
	- VA Research Database
	- Million Veterans Project
1. Computational models to classify atrial fibrillation based on clinical, ECG, echocardiographic parameters
1. Intracardiac monitoring will be used to generate features from EPS (electrophysiological studies) for clustering
	- left atrial volume
	- scar/fractionation
	- dominant pulmonary vein frequencies
	- voltage / viability
	- ectopy
1. Classification clusters will be validated against EPS in a prospective manner

## {.smaller}

__Identify phenotypes of triggered atrial arrhythmia.__

Current classification of atrial fibrillation subtypes is inadequate to determine association between symptom burden, clinical trajectory, and treatment response. We will use computational/machine-learning approaches in identifying and reclassifying triggered atrial arrhythmias.

a. Using clinical, ECG, and echocardiographic parameters, atrial fibrillation can be [classified into reliable/stable clusters]{.green}
a. Clusters will [correlate with intracardiac features]{.orange} from EPS
