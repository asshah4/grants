# Background

- Arrhythmia thresholds affected by sympathetic and vagal activity 
- Sympathetic neurons released both NE and NPY which inhibits anticholinergic activity
- Adrenergic neurons release catecholamines that directly affect the myocardium, but indirectly as well through neuropeptide Y (NPY)[@Coote2013]
- NPY binds to cholinergic neurons through the Y2 receptor, inhibiting firing and leading to vagolytic effects on the myocardium[@Kalla2020; @Herring2008]
- NPY receptors exist along the neurocardiac axis, including adrenal medulla (Y3) and cardiac tissue (Y2)
- Mutations have been found in rs16147 and perceived stress [@Chang2016]

## Background {.smaller}

- Intracardiac cross-talk between adrenergic (sympathetic) and cholinergic (vagal) neurons in the hierarchy of neurocardiac axis is critical for arrhythmogenesis during mental stress
- Atria are heavily innervated by autonomic ganglionic plexi, leading to the complex activity that regulates cardiac conductive properties[@Hoover2009; @Armour1997] 
- Sympathetic nervous activity is slower onset, but vagolysis is rapid, thus being a more likely causal component of arrhythmogenesis

## Background {.smaller}

- Research work has started to evaluate clusters of AF phenotypes using small computational models
- Triggered forms of arrhythmias, such as pulmonary vein triggers of atrial fibrillation, have different physiological and epidemiological characteristics forming unique phenotypes.
- Vagal AF is likely a triggered subtype

# Aims

## Aim #1: Translational/Computational {.smaller}

1. __To identify the effect of mental stress on triggered arrhythmias.__
_Mental stress leads to decrease in arrhythmia threshold by acute vagolysis._
	a. Mental stress challenge will lead to acute [decrease in arrhythmia threshold]{.orange} from baseline.
	a. Catecholamine infusion during mental stress challenge will to a [greater decrease in arrhythmia threshold]{.orange}.
	a. VNS during mental stress challenge will [protect against decreases in arrhythmia threshold]{.orange}.

EPS = electrophysiology study;
VNS = vagal nerve stimulation;
:::

## Aim #2: Epidemiology/Computational

2. __To classify phenotypes of triggered atrial arrhythmias__.
_Clinical phenotypes of atrial arrhythmias exist that have differential responses to therapy._
	a. Surface/non-invasive clinical features will identify stable, novel [clusters of arrhythmia phenotypes]{.blue}.
	a. Identified clusters will correlate with [arrhythmia phenotypes generated from intracardiac features]{.green} obtained from EPS.

AF = atrial fibrillation;

## Methods {.smaller}

1. Create cohort from "big data"
	a. e.g. UIC/CCTS, ARIC, MVP
1. Computational models to classify atrial fibrillation based on clinical, ECG, echocardiographic parameters
1. Intracardiac monitoring will be used to generate features from EPS for clustering
	a. e.g. LA volume, scar/voltage, complex fractionated atrial electrograms, dominant PV frequencies, ectopy
1. Classification clusters will be validated against EPS in a prospective manner

CCTS = Center for Translational Research;
ARIC = Atherosclerotic Risk in Communities;
MVP = Million Veterans Project;
LA = left atrium;
PV = pulmonary veins;
EPS = electrophysiology study
:::

## Aim #2: Epidemiology/Genetics {.smaller}

2. __To identify genetic and molecular markers associated with inappropriate vagolysis__. 
_Inappropriate vagolysis results from differential expression of autonomic hormones and receptors along the neurocardiac axis._
	a. Those with an increased arrhythmia burden will have higher levels of catecholamines and NPY levels after mental stress challenge.
	a. Those with an increased arrhythmia burden will have an increased burden of genetic polymorphisms in the NPY and its receptors.

::: aside
NPY = neuropeptide Y;
:::

## Methods

1. Collect blood during EPS for atrial arrhythmias (paroxysmal/triggered)
	a. DNA samples
	a. Catecholamine levels
	a. NPY levels
1. Whole exome sequencing of DNA to identify SNP in NPY regions
1. Correlate arrhythmia phenotype with NPY variants
