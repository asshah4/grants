# 1. Vagolysis/Arrhythmias

## Background {.smaller}

__Mechanism__: The key mechanism to explore is intracardiac cross-talk between adrenergic (sympathetic) and cholinergic (vagal) neurons.
	
- Atria are heavily innervated by autonomic ganglionic plexi, leading to the complex activity that regulates cardiac conductive properties[@Hoover2009; @Armour1997] 
- Adrenergic neurons release catecholamines that directly affect the myocardium, but indirectly as well through neuropeptide Y (NPY)[@Coote2013]
- NPY binds to cholinergic neurons through the Y2 receptor, inhibiting firing and leading to vagolytic effects on the myocardium[@Kalla2020; @Herring2008]

## Methods {.smaller}

1. Ex-vivo, vagal-sparing whole heart explant of murine model in Langendorf preparation[@Hennis2022]
1. Exposures are varying levels of sympathetic and vagal stimulation
	- nor epinephrine infusion (NE)
	- neuropeptide Y infusion (NPY)
	- vagal nerve stimulation (VNS)
	- beta blockade (BB)
	- Y2 receptor antagonism (Y2Ra) 
1. Outcomes will be measurement of myocardial conductioin properties
	- phase/slope changes
	- after-depolarization
	- ectopy
	- velocity

__Explore the role of vagolysis in triggered arrhythmias.__

In a murine model of arrhythmia, we will measure myocardial conduction properties (phase slope changes, after-depolarizations, ectopy, velocity) with and without adrenergic stimulation, NPY infusion, VNS, and Y2R antagonism.

a. In the setting of catecholamine infusion, NPY will [increase arrhythmias]{.red} and Y2Ra will [decrease arrhythmias]{.blue}
a. In the setting of catecholamine infusion, addition of NPY and Y2Ra simulatenously will have [no effect on arrhythmias]{.grey}
a. In the setting of VNS, addition of NPY will [increase arrhythmias]{.red} and addition of Y2Ra will [decrease arrhythmias]{.blue} 
	
# 2. Arrhythmic Phenotypes

## Background {.smaller}

__Mechanism__: Triggered forms of arrhythmias, such as pulmonary vein triggers of atrial fibrillation, have different physiological and epidemiological characteristics forming unique phenotypes.

> TO BE DETERMINED

## Methods {.smaller}

1. Create cohort from "big data" 
	- UIC/CCTS
	- Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study
	- VA Research Database
	- Million Veterans Project
1. Computational models to classify atrial fibrillation based on clinical, ECG, echocardiographic parameters
1. Intracardiac monitoring will be used to generate features from EPS (electrophysiological studies) for clustering
	- left atrial volume
	- scar/fractionation
	- dominant pulmonary vein frequencies
	- voltage / viability
	- ectopy
1. Classification clusters will be validated against EPS in a prospective manner

__Identify phenotypes of triggered atrial arrhythmia.__

Current classification of atrial fibrillation subtypes is inadequate to determine association between symptom burden, clinical trajectory, and treatment response. We will use computational/machine-learning approaches in identifying and reclassifying triggered atrial arrhythmias.

a. Using clinical, ECG, and echocardiographic parameters, atrial fibrillation can be [classified into reliable/stable clusters]{.green}
a. Clusters will [correlate with intracardiac features]{.orange} from EPS
