Likely due to changes in sympathovagal balance Vagal withdrawal increases risk High sympathetic tone increases risk ANS function can be quantified in several ways Invasive/extensive MSNA Reactive hyperemia Venous adrenergic Non-invasive ECG morphology (T wave area, Time-independent HRV (e.g. geometric, PSA) Time-dependent HRV (e.g. HRT, Dyx) Quantification of ANS tone Identifying ANS tone can identify at-risk individuals Can also test if treatment/interventions are successful Importance Few studies look at MSNA and ECG findings in real-time?\n\n\nHypothesis\n\ndisturbances of neurocardiac axis lead to ANS dysfunction\nquantified measures of ANS tone will reflect brain and heart metrics\nECG measures reflect this (PEP, T wave repolarization, HRV)\n\n\n\nAims\nDetermine relationship between MSNA and ECG findings during mental stress. P-wave morphology GEH TWA Measure correlation of MSNA with other non-invasive measures of autonomic tone SKNA VOP ML to detect ECG features that associate with MSNA\nECG data and cardiac catherization Have already enrolled ~ 200 patients Will have up to 2 years of data follow-up and outcomes Refine feature analysis and algorithm to detect CAD Add retrospective data on prior stress test (heavy chart review) Add machine learning or digital signal processing coursework MSNA and ECG clinical outcomes MSNA data has been collected with Jeanie Park"
