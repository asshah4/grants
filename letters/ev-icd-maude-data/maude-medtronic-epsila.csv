IT WAS NOTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN HAD NOTICED AN INFECTION AT THE INCISION SITE A MONTH AGO AND INITIALLY DECIDED TO ADMINISTER ANTIBIOTICS CHRONICALLY. BUT INSTEAD OF IMPROVING, THE INCISION WORSENED, ULTIMATELY EXPOSING THE EXTRAVASCULAR (EV) LEAD. THE PHYSICIAN SAID THEY ANALYZED THE INFECTION, BUT ALL TESTS RETURNED NEGATIVE. THE POCKET WAS FREE OF INFECTION AND IT WAS NOTED THAT AN ANTIBACTERIAL ABSORBABLE ENVELOPE HAD BEEN USED IN THE POCKET DURING THE DEVICE IMPLANT. THEY CONSIDERED LEAVING THE EC-ICD AND REMOVING ONLY THE EV-LEAD, PLANNING TO ATTEMPT ANOTHER LEAD IMPLANT ONCE THE INFECTION RESOLVED, BUT DECIDED NOT TO DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT ONGOING ISSUES WITH THIS PATIENT. THEREFORE, THE EV-ICD SYSTEM WAS EXTRACTED. AT THE EXTRACTION PROCEDURE THEY FOUND THAT THE SUTURES AROUND THE ANCHORING SLEEVE HAD COMPLETELY VANISHED, LEAVING THE EV-LEAD LOOSE AT THE INCISION SITE. THE PHYSICIAN ASSURED THAT THE SUTURES WERE CORRECTLY PLACED DURING THE IMPLANT PROCEDURE, AS THE SURGEON HIMSELF PERFORMED THIS STEP WITH EXTRA CAUTION, WITH ANOTHER PHYSICIAN PRESENT. THEREFORE, THE PHYSICIAN ATTRIBUTED THE SUTURE DAMAGE TO THE PATIENT¿S INFECTION. NO FURTHER PATIENT COMPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT.
