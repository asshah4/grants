A GOOD FAITH EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO OBTAIN THE APPLICABLE INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE REPORT. IF INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN THE FUTURE, A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE ISSUED. Manufacturer Narrative: A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT IS BEING SUBMITTED FOR INVESTIGATION COMPLETION. PRODUCT EVENT SUMMARY: ONE VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE (VAD) (B)(6) AND FOUR CONTROLLERS (B)(6) WERE RETURNED FOR EV ALUATION. ONE VAD (B)(6) WAS NOT RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. NO PERFORMANCE ALLEGATIONS WERE MADE AGAINST (B)(6). A REVIEW OF (B)(6)'S MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION CONFIRMED THAT THE PUMP MET ALL REQUIREMENTS FOR RELEASE. VARIOUS ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED AND REVIEWED TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RETURNED DEVICES IN RELATION TO THE REPORTED EVENT. FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE RETURNED CONTROLLERS (B)(6) REVEALED THAT THE DEVICES PASSED VISUAL INSPECTION AND FUNCTIONAL TESTING. INTERNAL INSPECTION OF (B)(6) DID NOT REVEAL ANY ANOMALIES. FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE RETURNED (B)(6) REVEALED THAT THE DEVICE PASSED FUNCTIONAL TESTING. HOWEVER, VISUAL INSPECTION REVEALED THAT THE UNIT HAD A FOREIGN LABEL THAT WAS OBSTRUCTING THE GORE-TEX MEMBRANE. THE GORE-TEX MEMBRANE, WHICH ALLOWS AIR TO PENETRATE THE CONTROLLER BUT NOT FLUID INGRESS, ENABLES EQUALIZATION OF PRESSURE AND ENSURES PROPER LOUDNESS OF ALL ALARMS. THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL OBSERVATION NOT RELATED TO THE REPORTED EVENT AND LIKELY DUE TO THE HANDLING OF THE DEVICE. ADDITIONALLY, VISUAL INSPECTION OF (B)(6) REVEALED SIGNS OF CLEANING RESIDUE INSIDE THE DRIVELINE CONNECTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DRIVELINE CONNECTOR CLEANING PROCEDURE. RETURNED PUMP (B)(6) WAS RECEIVED WITH THE DRIVELINE CABLE CUT AT APPROXIMATELY 8.5CM FROM THE PUMP¿S HEADER. VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE DRIVELINE CABLE, HEADER AND DRIVELINE CONNECTOR DID NOT REVEAL ANY DAMAGE OR ANOMALIES. INTERNAL PATHOLOGICAL REPORT REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF THROMBUS WITHIN THE DEVICE. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF MECHANICAL ABRASION OR ABNORMAL WEAR OF THE IMPELLER OR ON THE PUMP HOUSING SURFACES. SUPPLEMENTAL TESTING CONDUCTED WITH THE SPLICED DRIVELINE CABLE, A REPRESENTATIVE PUMP, AND RETURNED CONTROLLERS DID NOT SHOW ANOMALIES AND THE SYSTEM PERFORMED AS INTENDED. ADDITIONAL INSPECTION ON THE PUMP FRONT AND REAR STATORS IDENTIFIED HIGH RESISTANCE ON ONE PHASE OF THE FRONT STATOR. INTERNAL VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE RETURNED PUMP REVEALED DAMAGE ON COIL A AND COIL B OF THE FRONT STATOR ASSEMBLY. THIS DAMAGE PREVENTED THE FRONT STATOR FROM PERFORMING AS INTENDED, THUS LEADING TO THE REPORTED ELECTRICAL FAULTS AND POSSIBLY TO THE PUMP BEING UNABLE TO RE-START. LOG FILE ANALYSIS PERTAINING TO (B)(6) REVEALED MULTIPLE ELECTRICAL FAULT ALARMS WITHIN (B)(6) 2019 AT 11:44:55 AND (B)(6) 2019 AT 09:45:36 DUE TO AN OPEN PHASE B ON THE FRONT STATOR. LOG FILE ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED 4 HIGH WATT ALARMS ON (B)(6) 2019 DUE TO THE INCREASED POWER CONSUMPTION NEEDED TO RUN ON A SINGLE STATOR. LOG FILE ANALYSIS PERTAINING TO (B)(6) REVEALED 3 ELECTRICAL FAULT ALARMS ON (B)(6) 2019 WITHIN 09:52:24 AND 10:24:55 DUE TO THE FRONT STATOR NOT BEING CONNECTED. THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY ONE HIGH WATT ALARM AT 11:19:53 DUE TO THE INCREASED POWER CONSUMPTION NEEDED TO RUN ON A SINGLE STATOR. LOG FILE ANALYSIS PERTAINING TO (B)(6) REVEALED MULTIPLE ELECTRICAL FAULT ALARMS LOGGED WITHIN (B)(6) 2019 AT 12:00:52 AND (B)(6) 2019 AT 8:41:42 DUE TO AN OPEN PHASE B ON THE FRONT STATOR. LOG FILE ANALYSIS PERTAINING TO (B)(6) REVEALED THREE ELECTRICAL FAULT ALARMS ON (B)(6) 2019 WITHIN 11:08:28 AND 11:10:27 DUE TO A FRONT STATOR NOT BEING CONNECTED. THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY A VAD STOPPED ALARM AT 11:11:27 INDICATING THAT THE PUMP FAILED TO RESTART ON MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS. TWO VAD DISCONNECT ALARMS WERE RECORDED INDICATING THAT THE DRIVELINE WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE CONTROLLER. THE VAD DISCONNECT ALARMS WERE LIKELY AN ATTEMPT TO TROUBLESHOOT THE ELECTRICAL FAULT ALARMS. AS A RESULT, THE REPORTED ELECTRICAL FAULT ALARMS AND FAILURE TO RESTART EVENTS WERE CONFIRMED. DRIVELINE CLEANING PROCEDURES WERE PERFORMED ON SITE TO ADDRESS THE ELECTRICAL FAULTS; HOWEVER, THE ELECTRICAL FAULTS COULD NOT BE RESOLVED. THE REPORTED BENT PINS AND DATA LOGS UNABLE TO BE DOWNLOADED FROM THE CONTROLLER COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION, A POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSE OF THE REPORTED ELECTRICAL FAULT ALARMS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A DAMAGED COIL ON FRONT STATOR PHASE ¿B¿ AS FOUND DURING ANALYSIS OF THE PUMP. THIS DAMAGE ALSO MAY HAVE POSSIBLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE PUMP BEING UNABLE TO RESTART. THE MOST LIKELY ROOT CAUSE OF THE REPORTED HIGH WATT ALARMS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASED POWER CONSUMPTION NEEDED TO RUN ON A SINGLE STATOR. THE MOST LIKELY ROOT CAUSE OF THE VAD DISCONNECT ALARMS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO A PHYSICAL DISCONNECTION OF THE DRIVELINE FROM THE CONTROLLER. AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN INITIATED TO INVESTIGATE DAMAGED COILS ON THE PUMP'S STATOR. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE SITE INDICATED THAT, APPROXIMATELY TWO MONTHS FOLLOWING THE VAD EXCHANGE, THE PATIENT WAS ON A VENTILATOR AND WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXTUBATED. AFTER APPROXIMATELY ONE MORE MONTH, THE PATIENT DIED DUE TO MULTISYSTEM ORGAN FAILURE. POSSIBLE CLINICAL FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE PATIENT'S DEATH MAY INCLUDE THE PATIENT¿S PRE-EXISTING HISTORY AND RELATED COMORBIDITIES, THE PROGRESSION OF THEIR UNDERLYING DISEASE, ISSUES RELATED TO THE THERAPEUTIC USE OF ANTICOAGULANT AND ANTIPLATELET MEDICATIONS AND THE PATIENT'S COMPLEX POST-OPERATIVE COURSE; THERE ARE POSSIBLE PATIENT, PHARMACOLOGICAL AND PROCEDURAL FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS EVENT.

RETURNED VAD WAS RECEIVED WITH THE DRIVELINE CABLE CUT AT APPROXIMATELY 8.5CM FROM THE VAD¿S HEADER. VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE DRIVELINE CABLE, HEADER AND DRIVELINE CONNECTOR DID NOT REVEAL ANY DAMAGE OR ANOMALIES. INTERNAL PATHOLOGICAL REPORT REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF THROMBUS WITHIN THE DEVICE. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF MECHANICAL ABRASION OR ABNORMAL WEAR OF THE IMPELLER OR ON THE PUMP HOUSING SURFACES. SUPPLEMENTAL TESTING CONDUCTED WITH THE SPLICED DRIVELINE CABLE, A REPRESENTATIVE VAD, AND RETURNED CONTROLLERS DID NOT SHOW ANOMALIES AND THE SYSTEM PERFORMED AS INTENDED. ADDITIONAL INSPECTION ON THE PUMP FRONT AND REAR STATORS IDENTIFIED HIGH RESISTANCE ON ONE PHASE OF THE FRONT STATOR. INTERNAL VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE RETURNED PUMP REVEALED DAMAGE ON COIL A AND COIL B OF THE FRONT STATOR ASSEMBLY. THIS DAMAGE PREVENTED THE FRONT STATOR FROM PERFORMING AS INTENDED, THUS LEADING TO THE REPORTED ELECTRICAL FAULTS AND POSSIBLY TO THE VAD BEING UNABLE TO RE-START. LOG FILE ANALYSIS PERTAINING TO (B)(6) REVEALED MULTIPLE ELECTRICAL FAULT ALARMS WITHIN (B)(6) 2019 AT 11:44:55 AND (B)(6) 2019 AT 09:45:36 DUE TO AN OPEN PHASE B ON THE FRONT STATOR. LOG FILE ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED FOUR HIGH WATT ALARMS ON (B)(6) 2019 DUE TO THE INCREASED POWER CONSUMPTION NEEDED TO RUN ON A SINGLE STATOR. LOG FILE ANALYSIS PERTAINING TO (B)(6) REVEALED THREE ELECTRICAL FAULT ALARMS ON (B)(6) 2019 WITHIN 09:52:24 AND 10:24:55 DUE TO THE FRONT STATOR NOT BEING CONNECTED. THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY ONE HIGH WATT ALARM AT 11:19:53 DUE TO THE INCREASED POWER CONSUMPTION NEEDED TO RUN ON A SINGLE STATOR. LOG FILE ANALYSIS PERTAINING TO (B)(6) REVEALED MULTIPLE ELECTRICAL FAULT ALARMS LOGGED WITHIN (B)(6) 2019 AT 12:00:52 AND (B)(6) 2019 AT 8:41:42 DUE TO AN OPEN PHASE B ON THE FRONT STATOR.

THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY A VAD STOPPED ALARM AT 11:11:27 INDICATING THAT THE PUMP FAILED TO RESTART ON MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS. TWO VAD DISCONNECT ALARMS WERE RECORDED INDICATING THAT THE DRIVELINE WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE CONTROLLER. THE VAD DISCONNECT ALARMS WERE LIKELY AN ATTEMPT TO TROUBLESHOOT THE ELECTRICAL FAULT ALARMS. AS A RESULT, THE REPORTED ELECTRICAL FAULT ALARMS AND FAILURE TO RESTART EVENTS WERE CONFIRMED. DRIVELINE CLEANING PROCEDURES WERE PERFORMED ON SITE TO ADDRE SS THE ELECTRICAL FAULTS; HOWEVER, THE ELECTRICAL FAULTS COULD NOT BE RESOLVED. THE REPORTED BENT PINS AND DATA LOGS UNABLE TO BE DOWNLOADED FROM THE CONTROLLER COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION, A POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSE OF THE REPORTED ELECTRICAL FAULT ALARMS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A DAMAGED COIL ON FRONT STATOR PHASE ¿B¿ AS FOUND DURING ANALYSIS OF THE VAD. THIS DAMAGE ALSO MAY HAVE POSSIBLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE PUMP BEING UNABLE TO RESTART. THE MOST LIKELY ROOT CAUSE OF THE REPORTED HIGH WATT ALARMS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASED POWER CONSUMPTION NEEDED TO RUN ON A SINGLE STATOR.

INAPPROPRIATE DISCONNECTION BEEPS WERE HEARD AND THE CONTROLLER SHOWED A LOW PRIORITY LIGHT WITH AN AUDIBLE ALARM AND A VISUAL NOTIFICATION OF ¿CONNECT BATTERY ONE AND BATTERY TWO¿ WHEN THE CONTROLLER WAS FULLY CONNECTED TO THE ADAPTER AND ONE BATTERY. THE PATIENT CHANGED TO TWO FULLY CHARGED BATTERIES; HOWEVER, THESE RAPIDLY DISCHARGED WITHIN A SHORT TIME PERIOD. THE FOLLOWING DAY, THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED A DOUBLE POWER DISCONNECT ALARM WITH LOSS OF POWER TO THEIR CONTROLLER. THE CONTROLLER SCREEN ¿WENT BLACK¿ AND, AFTER POWERING BACK ON, HAD A CONTINUOUS ALARM. THE PATIENT REPORTED FEELING DIZZY, LIGHTHEADED, ¿WOOZY,¿ AND ¿OVERALL NOT GOOD¿ WHEN THE PUMP WAS OFF. IT WAS DECIDED TO MONITOR THE PATIENT IN RELATION TO THE HIGH WATT ALARMS AS THE PATIENT¿S INTERNATIONAL NORMALIZED RATIO (INR) WAS NORMAL AND THE Y WERE ASYMPTOMATIC. THE CONTROLLER AND BATTERIES WERE EXCHANGED. THE CONTROLLER AC ADAPTER AND VAD REMAIN IN USE. NO FURTHER PATIENT COMPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT. Manufacturer Narrative: THE CONTROLLER AND THREE BATTERIES WERE RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. THE HVAD AND CONTROLLER AC ADAPTER WERE NOT RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE RETURNED BATTERIES AND CONTROLLER REVEALED THAT THE DEVICES PASSED VISUAL EXAMINATION AND FUNCTIONAL TESTING. THE REPORTED BATTERY ""RAPID DISCHARGE"" EVENT COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED; THE BATTERIES CHARGED AND DISCHARGED NORMALLY DURING TESTING. LOG FILE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE CONTROLLER, CON314005, CONTAINED A FEATURE THAT RECORDS WHETHER A POWER SOURCE EXPERIENCED A COMMUNICATION ERROR OR A DISCONNECTION WITHIN EACH 15-MINUTE INTERVAL. ANALYSIS OF THE DATA LOG FILE REVEALED SEVERAL PREMATURE POWER SWITCHING EVENTS DUE TO MOMENTARY DISCONNECTIONS INVOLVING BATTERIES BAT317477 AND BAT322302, AS WELL AS PREMATURE POWER SWITCHING DUE TO COMMUNICATION ERRORS INVOLVING AN ADDITIONAL BATTERY. ADDITIONALLY, MOMENTARY DISCONNECTIONS WHICH DID NOT LEAD TO PREMATURE POWER SWITCHING WERE LOGGED INVOLVING BAT314751. MOMENTARY DISCONNECTION WILL RESULT IN AN AUDIBLE TONE OR ""BEEP."" AS A RESULT, THE REPORTED POWER SWITCHING EVENTS AND REPORTED ""BEEPING"" WERE CONFIRMED. ANALYSIS OF THE ALARM LOG FILE DID NOT REVEAL ANY POWER DIS CONNECT ALARMS LOGGED WITHIN THE ANALYZED PERIOD. AS A RESULT, THE REPORTED POWER DISCONNECT ALARMS COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED. ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT LOG FILE REVEALED TWO CONTROLLER POWER UPS WITH THEIR ASSOCIATED MOTOR STARTS ON (B)(6) 2018 AT 16:58:08 AND ON (B)(6) 2018 AT 19:09:32. THE DATA POINT RECORDED ON THE CONTROLLER'S INTERNAL LOGS PRIOR TO THE FIRST CONTROLLER POWER UP REVEALED THAT AN ADAPTER WAS CONNECTED TO POWER PORT ONE AND BAT301731 WAS CONNECTED TO POWER PORT TWO WITH 89% RELATIVE STATE OF CHARGE (RSOC). THE DATA POINT RECORDED AFTER THE LOSS OF POWER REVEALED THAT AN ADAPTER WAS CONNECTED TO POWER PORT ONE AND BAT301731 WAS CONNECTED TO POWER PORT TWO. THE DATA POINT RECORDED ON THE CONTROLLER'S INTERNAL LOGS PRIOR TO THE SECOND CONTROLLER POWER UP REVEALED THAT AN ADAPTER WAS CONNECTED TO POWER PORT ONE AND BAT322464 WAS CONNECTED TO POWER PORT TWO WITH 95% RSOC. THE DATA POINT RECORDED AFTER THE LOSS OF POWER REVEALED THAT BAT312896 WAS CONNECTED TO POWER PORT ONE AND BAT322464 WAS CONNECTED TO POWER PORT TWO. SEVERAL MOMENTARY DISCONNECTIONS WERE RECORDED LEADING UP TO THE LOSS OF POWER ON (B)(6) 2018. THE CONTROLLER WAS WITHOUT POWER FOR 15 SECONDS AND 11 SECONDS, RESPECTIVELY. LOSS OF POWER TO THE CONTROLLER WILL TRIGGER THE DISPLAY TO BECOME DARK AND SHOW NO PARAMETER S AND RESULT IN A CONTINUOUS AUDIBLE ALARM, WHICH CORRESPONDS WITH THE ""CONTINUOUS ALARM"" HEARD. AS A RESULT, THE REPORTED LOSS OF POWER EVENT WAS CONFIRMED. LOG FILE ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED TWO HIGH WATT ALARMS SINCE (B)(6) 2018. AS A RESULT, THE REPORTED HIGH WATT ALARMS WERE CONFIRMED. BASED ON HISTORICAL REVIEW OF SIMILAR HIGH POWER EVENTS, THE MOST LIKELY ROOT CAUSE OF THE HIGH POWER EVENT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS THROMBUS FORMATION/INGESTION. THE MOST LIKELY ROOT CAUSE OF THE REPORTED POWER SWITCHING EVENT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO MOMENTARY DISCONNECTIONS AND COMMUNICATION ERRORS BETWEEN THE CONTROLLER AND BATTERIES. HOWEVER, THE MOST LIKELY ROOT CAUSE OF THE REPORTED ""BEEPS"" CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO MOMENTARY DISCONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE CONTROLLER AND BATTERIES. A POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSE OF THE REPORTED POWER DISCONNECT ALARMS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED, BUT NOT LIMITED, TO A MARGINAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE BATTERIES AND CONTROLLER. A POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSE OF THE LOSS OF POWER CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A DISCONNECTION OF BOTH POWER SOURCES AND/OR TO AN INTERMITTENT DISCONNECTION ON ONE OR BOTH POWER SOURCES. AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION WAS INITIATED TO CAPTURE EVENTS INVOLVING THE CONTROLLER LOSING POWER. AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INVESTIGATED MOMENTARY DISCONNECTIONS.
