ADDITIONAL P-WAVE OVERSENSING WAS OBSERVED A FEW DAYS LATER, AND LOW R-WAVES WERE ALSO NOTED. INITIAL REPROGRAMMING WAS ATTEMPTED WHICH RESULTED IN NOISE OVERSENSING SO FURTHER REPROGRAMMING WAS PERFORMED, HOWEVER THIS RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL EPISODES OF P-WAVE OVERSENSING AS WELL AS EPISODES OF NOISE FOR WHICH THERAPIES WERE APPROPRIATELY WITHHELD. MULTIPLE X-RAYS WERE TAKEN AND WERE REVIEWED BY THE IMPLANTING PHYSICIAN,AND THE IMPLANTING PHYSICIAN STATED THE LEAD POSITION WAS STABLE AND UNCHANGED SINCE IMPLANT. ADDITIONAL REPROGRAMMING WAS THEN TAKEN WITH THERAPIES PROGRAMMED OFF TO SEE IF THE LATEST REPROGRAMMING RESOLVED THE OVERSENSING. THE FOLLOWING DAY, IT WAS REPORTED THAT THERE WAS VARIABILITY IN LEAD IMPEDANCES, AND A DROP IN PACING IMPEDANCES AND HIGH-VOLTAGE IMPEDANCE WERE OBSERVED. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK DUE TO OVERSENSING, BUT NOTED THAT THE SHOCK BROKE THE PATIENT'S ATRIAL FLUTTER. IT WAS STATED THAT THE OVERSENSING OCCURRED WHEN THE PATIENT WAS IN ATRIAL FLUTTER, BUT ONCE THE PATIENT IS IN SINUS RHYTHM, THE OVERSENSING DOES NOT OCCUR.

AFTER ABLATION WAS CARRIED OUT SUCCESSFULLY FOR THREE RUNS, THE ROTALINK PLUS WAS REMOVED FROM THE MICROCATHETER. AS THE ROTALINK PLUS WAS REMOVED VIA DYNAGLIDE MODE, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE ROTAWIRE WAS KINKED, THE STALLED OPTION APPEARED, AND THE ROTA SYSTEM (ROTALINK PLUS AND ROTAWIRE) WERE STUCK TOGETHER AND COULD NOT BE REMOVED PNEUMATICALLY. THE WHOLE SYSTEM WAS MANUALLY REMOVED AND THE PROCEDURE COMPLETED WITH ANOTHER OF SAME DEVICE. NO COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED AND THE PATIENT WAS STABLE POST PROCEDURE. Manufacturer Narrative: THE DEVICE WAS RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. THE PROXIMAL END, MIDDLE SECTION, DISTAL END, AND SPRING TIP WERE VISUALLY AND MICROSCOPICALLY EXAMINED. INSPECTION OF THE DEVICE FOUND A KINK AT 69CM FROM THE PROXIMAL END OF THE ROTAWIRE. DURING FUNCTIONAL TESTING, THE RETURNED ROTAWIRE WAS ABLE TO BE REMOVED WITH RESISTANCE, BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO BE REINSERTED DUE TO THE KINK IN THE ROTAWIRE. NO OTHER ISSUES WERE IDENTIFIED DURING THE PRODUCT ANALYSIS."

INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE LEFT VENTRICULAR EJECTION FRACTION (LVEF) <25%, SYMPTOMATIC HEART FAILURE (NYHA FUNCTIONAL CLASS III&IV), AND A DOCUMENTED EPISODE OF HEMODYNAMICALLY UNSTABLE MONOMORPHIC VT. THE PAAINESD SCORE, AS A CLINICAL TOOL FOR PREPROCEDURAL RISK STRATIFICATION, PUBLISHED IN 2015 WAS USED THEREAFTER.7,8 (TABLE 1 AND TABLE 2) THE PAAINESD RISK SCORE CONSISTS OF 8 CLINICAL PARAMETERS AND COULD RANGE FROM 0 TO 35 POINTS. THE SCORE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES: CHRONIC PULMONARY DISEASE (5 POINTS); AGE >60 YEARS (3 POINTS); GENERAL ANESTHESIA (4 POINTS); ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY (6 POINTS); NYHA FUNCTIONAL CLASS III OR IV (6 POINTS); EJECTION FRACTION <25% (3 POINTS); VT ELECTRICAL STORM (5 POINTS); AND DIABETES MELLITUS (3 POINTS). THE RISK OF PERI-PROCEDURAL AHD INCREASED ACROSS TERTILES RISK, AND THE SCORE WAS 2% FOR THE FIRST TERTILE (<10 POINTS), 6% IN THE SECOND TERTILE (10-16 POINTS), AND 24% IN THE THIRD TERTILE (>16 POINTS). INFORMED CONSENT WAS OBTAINED FROM ALL PATIENTS. THE STUDY PROTOCOL WAS APPROVED BY THE LOCAL ETHICS COMMITTEE. FOR CIRCULATORY SUPPORT, A MICRO-AXIAL 12 TO 14F BLOOD PUMP IMPELLA 2.5 OR IMPELLA CP (ABIOMED, DANVERS, MA) WAS USED EXCLUSIVELY. THE PLVAD WAS INSERTED VIA FEMORAL ARTERY AND POSITIONED IN AN ""OVER THE WIRE"" TECHNIQUE RETROGRADE CROSSING THE AORTIC VALVE INTO THE LEFT VENTRICLE. A SET FOR ARTERIOTOMY SITE CLOSURE WAS PLACED AT THE START OF THE ABLATION. MEASUREMENT OF BILATERAL CEREBRAL TISSUE OXYGEN SATURATION INVOS (COVIDIEN, MEDTRONIC, MINNEAPOLIS, MN) WAS USED FOR ADDITIONAL MONITORING OF ENDORGAN PERFUSION. VASOACTIVE DRUGS SUCH AS PHENYLEPHRINE AND NOREPINEPHRINE WERE ADMINISTERED TO MAINTAIN A MEAN BLOOD PRESSURE OF 60MMHG DURING VT EPISODES. HEPARIN WAS ADMINISTERED INTRAVENOUSLY TO MAINTAIN AN ACTIVATED CLOTTING TIME >300 SECONDS. FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF ABLATION PROCEDURE, THE PLVAD WAS LEFT IN PLACE AND ALL PATIENTS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT FOR FURTHER SURVEILLANCE. THE FIRST 6 PROCEDURES WERE PERFORMED UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA, THE FOLLOWING 22 PROCEDURES WERE PERFORMED UNDER SEDATION WITH PROPOFOL (ASTRAZENECA, LONDON, UK). THE METHODOLOGY AND TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF THE USE OF THE MICRO-AXIAL PLVAD HAS BEEN DESCRIBED IN DETAIL PREVIOUSLY.10,14 ALL VT ABLATION PROCEDURES WERE PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PUBLISHED GUIDELINES AND RECOMMENDATIONS.15-17 TWO THREE DIMENSIONAL (3D) ELECTRO-ANATOMIC MAPPING SYSTEMS WERE USED. THE ENSITE NAVX (ABBOTT, CHICAGO, IL) A SINGLE SENSOR IMPEDANCE BASED MAPPING SYSTEM WAS USED IN THE FIRST 22 CASES AND A DUAL SENSOR IMPEDANCE/ MAGNETIC BASED SYSTEM RHYTHMIA (BOSTON SCIENTIFIC, MARLBOROUGH, MA) WAS USED IN THE FINAL 6 CASES. AS THE FIRST STEP IN THE ABLATION PROCEDURE, ALL PATIENTS UNDERWENT A BIPOLAR SUBSTRATE MAPPING WITH STANDARD SIGNAL AMPLITUDE SETTINGS (<0.5 TO >1.5 MV). THE METHOD OF SUBSTRATE MAPPING AND ABLATION IS REVIEWED ELSEWHERE.18,19 SPONTANEOUSLY INDUCED MONOMORPHIC VT DURING SUBSTRATE ABLATION WAS ACTIVATION MAPPED AND ABLATED FOLLOWED BY COMPLETION OF SUBSTRATE ABLATION. PROGRAMMED VENTRICULAR STIMULATION WAS PERFORMED AFTER SUBSTRATE ABLATION IN ALL PATIENTS. STIMULATION PROTOCOL CONSISTS OF THREE BASIC DRIVE CYCLE LENGTH AND UP TO THREE EXTRA STIMULI. PROCEDURE SUCCESS AND COMPLETION OF THE PLANNED ABLATION PROTOCOL WAS DEFINED AS NON INDUCIBILITY OF MONOMORPHIC VT UP TO A CYCLE LENGTH OF 240 MS. IRRIGATED RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION WAS USED IN EACH PROCEDURE. ABLATION CATHETERS WERE INSERTED TRANSSEPTALLY VIA A STEERABLE SHEATH. ABLATION ENERGY WAS SET AT 40W WITH TEMPERATURE CONTROL OF 40C. RADIOFREQUENCY APPLICATIONS WERE CONTINUED FOR 60 SECONDS. EPICARDIAL MAPPING AND ABLATION PROCEDURES WERE NOT PERFORMED IN OUR PATIENT POPULATION. RESULTS: TWENTY-SIX CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT CATHETER VT ABLATIONS DURING THE STUDY PERIOD ARE INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT ANALYSIS. THE PLVAD WAS USED IN A PRE-EMPTIVE MANNER IN ALL BUT ONE PATIENT. THE PLVAD WAS SUCCESSFULLY IMPLANTED IN ALL PATIENTS. AN IMPELLA 2.5 WAS USED IN 23 PROCEDURES AND AN IMPELLA CP IN THE REMAINING 5 INTERVENTIONS. THE SWITCH FROM IMPELLA 2.5 TO IMPELLA CP WAS CAUSED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF THE NEWER DEVICE. MEAN AGE OF THE PATIENT POPULATION WAS 68 +/- 9 YEARS (RANGE 48 - 83 YEARS) WITH 100% MALE, AND MEAN LVEF OF 19.6% +/- 3%. ALL PATIENTS WERE IN NYHA FUNCTIONAL STATUS III AND IV, 22 PATIENTS HAD ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY. AN IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER/DEFIBRILLATOR WAS PREIMPLANTED IN ALL PATIENTS, WITH A CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION DEVICE IN 11 OF THEM. THE MEAN PAAINESD SCORE WAS 21 +/- 3 WITH 25 OF THE 26 PATIENTS HAVING A PAAINESD SCORE >16. SPONTANEOUS SUSTAINED VT OCCURRED DURING SUBSTRATE MAPPING/ABLATION IN 13 PATIENTS. PROGRAMMED VENTRICULAR STIMULATION-INDUCED VT OCCURRED IN 21 PATIENTS (19 OF THEM HAD MORE THAN 2 VT MORPHOLOGIES), AND THE MEAN CYCLE LENGTH OF ALL VT WAS 348 +/- 76MS (RANGED FROM 260 TO 500 MS). DURING THE ABLATION PROCEDURE, THE MEAN TIME OF ONGOING VT FOR PROPAGATION AND ENTRAINMENT MAPPING WAS 35 MINUTES (RANGING FROM 15 TO 76 MINUTES). ALL INDUCIBLE VT COULD BE ABLATED SUCCESSFULLY. THE MEDIAN PROCEDURE TIME WAS 190 MINUTES (RANGE 97-341 MINUTES). ADEQUATE CIRCULATORY SUPPORT WAS ACHIEVED IN ALL PATIENTS, EXCEPT IN ONE PATIENT WITH AN ACUTE ISCHEMIC EVENT. THIS PATIENT (LVEF OF 15% AND PAAINESD SCORE OF 18) PRESENTED WITH AN INCESSANT VT JUST AFTER THE CORONARY INTERVENTION AND WAS THE ONLY CASE OF BAIL-OUT USE OF PLVAD. DESPITE PLVAD USE ADEQUATE CIRCULATORY SUPPORT WAS NOT ACHIEVED AND THE ABLATION PROCEDURE WAS NOT COMPLETED AS PLANNED AND HAD TO BE TERMINATED PREMATURELY. IN 12 PROCEDURES NOREPINEPHRINE WAS USED AS A VASOPRESSOR AGENT WITH DOSES RANGING FROM 0.1 TO 1.2 G KG MIN. NO ELECTRICAL INTERFERENCE WITH THE PLVAD USE OCCURRED WITH THE USE OF THE IMPEDANCE BASED ENSITE NAVX ELECTROANATOMIC 3D MAPPING SYSTEM. HOWEVER, THE MOTOR UNIT OF BOTH IMPELLA DEVICES CAUSED SEVERE ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE WITH THE RHYTHMIA DUAL SENSOR ELECTROANATOMIC 3D MAPPING SYSTEM DURING MAGNETIC NAVIGATION. SEVERE ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE OCCURRED AT ANY DISTANCE BETWEEN ABLATION OR MAPPING CATHETER AND MOTOR UNIT AND AT ANY PERFORMANCE LEVEL OF THE MICRO-AXIAL BLOOD PUMP. REDUCTION OF THE PERFORMANCE LEVEL OF THE BLOOD PUMP FROM P8 TO P6 TO REDUCE ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE, AS REPORTED FOR CARTO 3 ELECTROANATOMIC MAPPING SYSTEM (BIOSENSE WEBSTER INC, DIAMOND BAR, CA), WAS NOT EFFECTIVE USING THE RHYTHMIA MAPPING SYSTEM.20 THERE WAS ONE INTRAHOSPITAL DEATH AND ONE ACUTE COMPLICATION IN THIS COHORT. THE PATIENT RECEIVING BAIL-OUT PLVAD DIED DAY 3 POSTINTERVENTION. A PARTIAL OBSTRUCTION OF THE IMPELLER DUE TO A FLAIL MITRAL CHORDAE RESULTED IN SEVERE HEMOLYSIS LEADING TO RENAL FAILURE AND NEED FOR RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY FOR 4 WEEKS, WITH THE PATIENT RECOVERING COMPLETELY. MINOR GROIN HEMATOMAS OCCURRED IN SEVEN PATIENTS. NO CARDIAC TAMPONADE OR THROMBOEMBOLIC COMPLICATION WAS OBSERVED. DISCUSSION: THE USE OF THE IMPELLA 2.5, MICRO-AXIAL BLOOD PUMP, FOR CIRCULATORY SUPPORT DURING VT CATHETER ABLATION, WAS FIRST REPORTED IN 2010.21 BE-BESIDES MICRO-AXIAL BLOOD PUMPS, OTHER DEVICES AS AORTIC COUNTERPULSATION, EXTRACORPOREAL MEMBRANE OXYGENATION (ECMO) AND TANDEM- HEART (CARDIAC ASSIST INC, PITTSBURGH, PA) WERE INTRODUCED FOR HEMODYNAMIC SUPPORT DURING CATHETER ABLATION OF UNSTABLE VT.7-9,13,22,23 THE CLINICAL ROLE OF MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY ASSIST DURING CATHETER VT ABLATION IS NOT WELL DEFINED DUE TO THE LACK OF LARGE SCALE, RANDOMIZED TRIALS AND THE CONTRADICTORY RESULTS OF SMALLER OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES.10,11,24-28 THE DEFIBRILLATOR INTERROGATION IN OUR PATIENT POPULATION REVEALED REPETITIVE, UNSTABLE, AND MONOMORPHIC VT WITH SIMILAR CYCLE LENGTH AND EGRAM MORPHOLOGY. THIS DOMINANT VT MORPHOLOGY WAS THE MAIN ABLATION TARGET. AFRAID OF MISSING THIS VT BY SOLE SUBSTRATE ABLATION WE DECIDED TO PERFORM ADDITIONAL ACTIVATION MAPPING WITH HEMODYNAMIC SUPPORT. THE PUBLISHED RESULTS INDICATE THAT ADEQUATE PATIENT SELECTION FOR CIRCULATORY SUPPORT DURING VT ABLATION IS CRUCIAL AND ONLY PATIENTS WITH A HIGH PROBABILITY FOR INTRAPROCEDURAL HEMODYNAMIC INSTABILITY MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE CANDIDATES FOR MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT. INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS DEMOGRAPHIC DATA OR RISK SCORING OF MULTIPLE PARAMETERS COULD IDENTIFY PATIENTS WITH A HIGH PROBABILITY FOR INTRAPROCEDURAL COMPLICATIONS.4-9,29 BEFORE THE PUBLICATION OF THE PAAINESD SCORE, ONLY THREE FACTORS WERE USED FOR RISK STRATIFICATION: LVEF <25%, SYMPTOMATIC ADVANCED HEART FAILURE, AND DOCUMENTED EPISODES OF HEMODYNAMIC UNSTABLE MONOMORPHIC VT. LATER ON, PATIENTS WERE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE PAAINESD SCORE, IDENTIFYING A COHORT WITH A VERY HIGH PROBABILITY FOR AHD DURING CATHETER VT ABLATION. ACCORDING TO RECENT STUDIES AHD IS A STRONG PREDICTOR FOR INTRAPROCEDURAL COMPLICATION AS WELL AS FOR EARLY AND LATE MORTALITY. AHD OCCURS IN ABOUT 11% OF ALL CATHETER VT ABLATIONS, CAUSING A 31% INCREASE IN ALL CAUSE MORTALITY WITHIN 21 MONTHS AFTER VT ABLATION.5,8 THEREFORE THE PREVENTION OF AHD IN A HIGH RISK PATIENT POPULATION MIGHT IMPROVE OUTCOME AFTER CATHETER VT ABLATION.8 SUBSTRATE MAPPING AND ABLATION IN VT ABLATION PROCEDURES MIGHT BE ONE WAY TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL ARRHYTHMOGENIC TISSUE WITHOUT ACTIVATION MAPPING AND VT INDUCTION IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED HEART FAILURE.18,19 COMPARISONS BETWEEN BOTH ABLATION STRATEGIES ARE MAINLY REPORTED IN PATIENTS WITH HEMODYNAMICALLY STABLE VT.30-32 HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THE VT BURDEN IN PROCEDURES BASED ON SUBSTRATE ABLATION AS WELL. SPONTANEOUS OCCURRENCE OF VT DURING SUBSTRATE MAPPING/ABLATION HAS BEEN REPORTED IN BETWEEN 20% AND 38%.31,32 IN OUR STUDY, 50% OF THE PATIENTS EXPERIENCED SPONTANEOUS, MONOMORPHIC, UNSTABLE, AND SUSTAINED VT DURING SUBSTRATE MAPPING/ ABLATION AS THE ""FIRST STEP"" 30 OF THE ABLATION PROCEDURE. THIS COULD BE EXPLAINED BY THE USE OF THE STIFFER 64 ELECTRODE BASKET MAPPING CATHETER (ORION; BOSTON SCIENTIFIC). WITHOUT ANY CIRCULATORY SUPPORT, EVERY VT OCCURRENCE CARRIES A HIGH-RISK OF AHD. DESPITE A MEAN DURATION OF ONGOING HEMODYNAMIC UNSTABLE VT OF 35 MINUTES, EFFECTIVE CIRCULATORY SUPPORT AND ADEQUATE END-ORGAN PERFUSION WAS ACHIEVED IN 27 OF 28 ABLATION PROCEDURES. HEMODYNAMIC SUPPORT FAILED IN ONE PATIENT RECEIVING BAIL-OUT THERAPY WITH IMPELLA 2.5 IN CARDIOGENIC SHOCK AFTER CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY. THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN PATIENTSOUTCOMES WITH PRE-EMPTIVE VS BAIL-OUT USE OF MECHANICAL HEMODYNAMIC SUPPORT HAVE BEEN REPORTED FOR MICRO-AXIAL BLOOD PUMPS AND TANDEMHEART33 AS WELL AS FOR ECMO SUPPORT.34,35 A BAIL-OUT USE OF ALL THREE HEMODYNAMIC SUPPORT DEVICES WAS ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH A LESS FAVORABLE PATIENT OUTCOME. THESE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR RISK STRATIFICATION BEFORE VT ABLATION. WE THINK THAT REGARDING THE NEED FOR MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT DURING CATHETER VT ABLATION PATIENTS RISK ASSESSMENT IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE PLANNED ABLATION STRATEGY ITSELF.

WE PRESENT A CASE OF A (B)(6)-YEAR-OLD MAN WITH PREVIOUS MECHANICAL MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENT WHO PRESENTED TO AN OUTSIDE HOSPITAL FOR PLANNED CARDIAC ABLATION FOR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. DURING THE PROCEDURE, WHILE ADVANCING THE INTELLA TIP ABLATION MICROCATHETER (BOSTON SCIENTIFIC, (B)(4), USA) ACROSS THE MECHANICAL MITRAL VALVE, THE MICROCATHETER WAS SHEARED, LEAVING THE DISTAL TIP INTRAVASCULARLY AND UNABLE TO BE RETRIEVED. HE WAS EMERGENTLY TRANSFERRED TO OUR INSTITUTION FOR FURTHER WORKUP AND TREATMENT. ON ARRIVAL, WORKUP INCLUDING CHEST X-RAY, ABDOMINAL X-RAY AND NECK X-RAY FAILED TO REVEAL THE RETAINED MICROCATHETER TIP. THEREFORE, A SKULL X-RAY WAS PERFORMED AND THEN CONFIRMED WITH HEAD CT SHOWING THE MICROCATHETER TIP PRESENT IN THE RIGHT M1 SEGMENT OF THE MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY. THE PATIENT ARRIVED NEUROLOGICALLY INTACT WITH ONLY SYMPTOMS OF A MILD HEADACHE. HE WAS STARTED ON A HEPARIN DRIP BUT BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF NEEDING FURTHER CARDIAC SURGERY, HE WAS NOT STARTED ON ANY FURTHER ANTICOAGULANT OR ANTIPLATELET THERAPY. DUE TO CONCERNS OF DEVELOPING A LARGE VESSEL OCCLUSION, HE WAS EMERGENTLY TAKEN TO THE NEURO INTERVENTIONAL SUITE FOR PLANNED REMOVAL OF THE RETAINED MICROCATHETER TIP. A NON-BOSTON SCIENTIFIC SHEATH WAS PLACED WITHIN THE RIGHT FEMORAL ARTERY AND A 5F NON-BOSTON SCIENTIFIC DIAGNOSTIC CATHETER ADVANCED WITHIN THE SHEATH, A RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM WAS THEN PERFORMED SHOWING THE RETAINED MICROCATHETER WITH THE RIGHT M1 SEGMENT OF THE MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY. THE HEATH WAS THEN ADVANCED INTO THE RIGHT CERVICAL INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY TO PROVIDE PROXIMAL SUPPORT. THE DIAGNOSTIC CATHETER WAS THEN EXCHANGED FOR A 6F NEURON GUIDE CATHETER (PENUMBRA). A NON-BOSTON SCIENTIFIC MICROWIRE AND MICROCATHETER WERE ADVANCED THROUGH A NON-BOSTON SCIENTIFIC GUIDE CATHETER. A NON-BOSTON SCIENTIFIC STENT RETRIEVER AND STENT RETRIEVER WERE BOTH UNSUCCESSFUL AT RETRIEVING THE RETAINED MICROCATHETER TIP.

THE ICE CATHETER WAS ALSO PLACED IN THE RIGHT ATRIUM. A SHEATH AND NEEDLE WERE USED FOR TRANSSEPTAL ACCESS; DUE TO THE PATIENT¿S ROTATED ANATOMY AND LOW FOSSA OVALIS, THE PHYSICIAN HAD DIFFICULTY GAINING ACCESS TO THE LEFT ATRIUM (LA). LA ACCESS WAS GAINED; THE ABLATION CATHETER WAS INSERTED THROUGH THE SHEATH AND SOME LA ANATOMY WAS CREATED. THE SHEATH WAS EXCHANGED FOR A SHEATH FROM A DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER, WHEN A DROP IN BLOOD PRESSURE WAS NOTICED AND A PERICARDIAL EFFUSION WAS OBSERVED BY THE ICE CATHETER. A PERICARDIAL DRAIN WAS PLACED. ALL CATHETERS WERE THEN REMOVED FROM THE HEART. MINIMAL EFFUSION WAS EVIDENT WHEN THE PATIENT LEFT THE ROOM IN STABLE CONDITION.

THE CUSTOMER REPORTS THE LIGHT GLOVE SPLIT WHEN PLACED ON THE OPERATING ROOM LIGHT. THE CUSTOMER FURTHER STATED THAT THE LITE GLOVE IS A LITTLE TIGHT WHEN PLACING ON THE HANDLE, THEY HAVE TO CONTINUALLY (SHOVE) IT ON THE HANDLE AND IS A LITTLE MORE CHALLENGING THAN BEFORE. THE SPLIT/TEAR WAS FOUND MOSTLY WHEN PLACING ON THE HANDLE DURING SETUP. ONE TIME WITH PATIENT IN ROOM AND INCISION MADE. ONCE THE SPLIT WAS NOTICED THEY WOULD REMOVE THE TOP GLOVE IF THEY DOUBLE GLOVE, AND IF THEY SINGLE GLOVE, THEY CHANGE THE GLOVE. THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT THE MATERIAL IS REALLY THIN. A SKYTRON AURORA ADAPTER IS BEING USED WITH THE LITE GLOVE. Manufacturer Narrative: COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY MEDTRONIC STATING THE DEVON LIGHT GLOVE SPLITS/TEARS AFTER APPLICATION TO THE SURGICAL LIGHT. THE COMPLAINTS INVOLVE LOTS MANUFACTURED MAY 2015 TO CURRENT. (B)(4) WAS OPENED JANUARY 2016 TO ADDRESS A SMALL (B)(4) POPULATION OF COMPLAINTS THAT WERE ALLEGEDLY ¿TOO TIGHT¿. THE CONDITION PRESENTED A CHALLENGE TO THE USER AS THE GLOVE WAS TOO TIGHT DURING THE INSTALLATION ONTO THE LIGHT HANDLE, MAKING THE INSTALLATION DIFFICULT TO IMPOSSIBLE, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR TEARS. A MULTIFUNCTIONAL TEAM REVIEWED THE COMPLAINTS AND FAILURE MODES AS PART THE CAPA INVESTIGATION. AN ISHIKAWA DIAGRAM WAS COMPLETED FOCUSING ON THE POTENTIAL CAUSES THAT COULD ORIGINATE THE REPORTED CONDITIONS. THE INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT WHILE THE PRODUCT MET SPECIFICATION AND THE OBSERVED COMPLAINT RATE WAS BELOW THE DMR REQUIREMENTS, PROCESS VARIATION COMBINED WITH THE DIMENSIONAL TOLERANCE BETWEEN THE INNER DIAMETER OF THE GLOVE AND THE CORRESPONDING HANDLE COULD LEAD TO APPLICATION FORCES THAT SPLIT THE LIGHT GLOVE DURING APPLICATION ONTO THE ASSOCIATED LIGHT HANDLE. THE DIMENSIONAL TOLERANCE WAS RELATED TO A SLIGHT REDUCTION OF THE INSIDE DIAMETER OF THE HANDLE COVER. THIS REDUCTION IN DIAMETER WAS IMPLEMENTED, ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS, TO ELIMINATE PLEATS IN THE GLOVE AND MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR SPLITS AND TEARS. THIS RESULTED IN A SMALL NUMBER OF LIGHT GLOVES THAT FIT TIGHTLY AND OR SPLIT WHEN APPLIED TO THE LIGHT HANDLE. IN JUNE 2016, THE CORRECTIVE ACTION WAS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH PROCESS MODIFICATIONS THAT INCLUDED UPDATES TO BOTH EQUIPMENT AND INSPECTION CRITERIA WHEREBY INSERTION FORCE WAS NOW MEASURED ON THE LINE. ADDITIONALLY, A FIELD SAFETY NOTICE COMMUNICATING AN UPDATE TO THE IFU WAS ISSUED SEPTEMBER 29, 2016 TO FURTHER MITIGATE THE RISK OF A TOO TIGHT OR SPLIT CONDITION. IN OCTOBER 2016, POST IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ABOVE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS, COMPLAINTS WERE RECEIVED REPORTING THE PRODUCT IS SPLIT IN THE PACKAGE, THE PRODUCT SPLIT/TORE DURING APPLICATION OR A SPLIT WAS DISCOVERED DURING OR POST PATIENT PROCEDURE. AS SUCH, (B)(4) WAS OPENED TO DOCUMENT THE INVESTIGATION AND ACTIONS TAKEN. THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT WHILE THE PRODUCT MEETS SPECIFICATION AND THE OBSERVED COMPLAINT RATE IS BELOW THE DMR REQUIREMENTS, ADDITIONAL TESTING AND REVIEW IS NECESSARY TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION TO FURTHER REDUCE RISK AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. ONGOING EFFORTS AT THIS TIME INCLUDE REVIEW OF THE MATERIAL, PROCESS PARAMETERS, AND DESIGN. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS ISSUE. IN JAN 2017 MEDTRONIC CONDUCTED A RECALL OF ITS COVIDIEN DEVON¿ LIGHT GLOVES DISTRIBUTED AS SINGLE STERILE ITEMS AND IN SPECIFIC PROCEDURE KITS. ALL LOT NUMBERS OF DEVON¿ LIGHT GLOVE DEVICES WITHIN EXPIRY BEGINNING WITH LOT NUMBER 630XXXXXXX AND LOWER ARE AFFECTED BY THIS FIELD ACTION. Manufacturer Narrative: SUBMIT DATE: 08/04/2016.
