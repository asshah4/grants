The problem can be broken down into two components: 1) a substrate and 2) a trigger. My area of focus on this problem is that of the trigger, combining stress epidemiology and triggered arrhythmias as the two major aims of my work in neurocardiology. My computational approach parallels these topics by combining biostatistics and digital signal processing.\nThis serves as a summary of current research progress, updates, and projects (clinical, translational, and programming).

    "text": "AHA IPA\n\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) remains the most common arrhythmia worldwide, afflicting over 1% of the population, but there is poor understanding of how the arrhythmia is triggered and maintained. Dilated atria are heavily coincident in AF not only in humans but across land mammals, such as the 2-3% burden seen in equine species. Growing evidence supports the role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in AF however, such as the sympathovagal imbalance prior to onset or protective effects of vagal tone in diving mammals. Establishing the important, pathological contribution of local vagolysis changes how we view the interplay of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, and allows us to take a novel direction in the management of an incredibly burdensome disease.\nThe atria are heavily innervated by autonomic ganglionic plexi, leading to the complex activity that regulates cardiac conductive properties. The key mechanism that we will explore is the intracardiac cross-talk between adrenergic (sympathetic) and cholinergic (vagal) neurons. Adrenergic neurons release catecholamines that directly affect the myocardium, but indirectly as well through neuropeptide Y (NPY). NPY binds to cholinergic neurons through the Y2R receptor, inhibiting firing and leading to vagolytic effects on the myocardium.\nWe propose that triggered AF occurs due to vagolysis in the setting of increased sympathetic activity. We hypothesize that 1) vagal stimulation protects against AF in pro-arrhythmic murine models, and 2) blockade of vagolysis through Y2R antagonism under increased sympathetic activity protects from AF and creates improve myocardial conductive properties. We will utilize ex-vivo, whole heart explants in vagal-sparing Langendorf preparations in an established murine model of AF. Vagal nerve stimulation protocols and catecholamine infusion will mimick local autonomic activity. We will measure atrial conductive properties (phase slope changes, after depolarizations, ectopy) at baseline, with infusion of NPY, and with Y2R antagonists. If, as we hypothesize, vagolysis leads to triggered AF, and NPY blockade rescues the arrhythmia burden, we will have established an innovative, causal mechanism in the pathogenesis of AF.\nOur lab is uniquely suited to explore these questions, as a leading center of murine and induced pluripotent stem cell models of atrial arrhythmias. We have demonstrated competence in patch clamping and measurement of cardiac tissue conductive properties through Langendorf preparations, and are able to leverage our extensive electrophysiological expertise with both basic and clinical scientists. Not only does this proposal explore the novel contribution of vagolysis in arrhythmogenesis, it identifies a pharmacological target for potential interventions."

    "text": "December 2, 2022\nAmerican Heart Association\n2023 Innovative Project Award\nThe Division of Cardiology at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is seeking support for an innovative approach to identifying a causal, mechanistic step in atrial fibrillation.\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) remains the most common arrhythmia worldwide, afflicting over 1% of the population, but there is poor understanding of how the arrhythmia is triggered and maintained. Dilated atria are heavily coincident in AF not only in humans but across land mammals, such as the 2-3% burden seen in equine species. Growing evidence supports the role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in AF however, such as the sympathovagal imbalance prior to onset or protective effects of vagal tone in diving mammals. Establishing the important, pathological contribution of local vagolysis changes how we view the interplay of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, and allows us to take a novel direction in the management of an incredibly burdensome disease.\nThe atria are heavily innervated by autonomic ganglionic plexi, leading to the complex activity that regulates cardiac conductive properties. The key mechanism that we will explore is the intracardiac cross-talk between adrenergic (sympathetic) and cholinergic (vagal) neurons. Adrenergic neurons release catecholamines that directly affect the myocardium, but indirectly as well through neuropeptide Y (NPY). NPY binds to cholinergic neurons through the Y2R receptor, inhibiting firing and leading to vagolytic effects on the myocardium.\nWe propose that triggered AF occurs due to vagolysis in the setting of increased sympathetic activity. We hypothesize that 1) vagal stimulation protects against AF in pro-arrhythmic murine models, and 2) blockade of vagolysis through Y2R antagonism under increased sympathetic activity protects from AF and creates improve myocardial conductive properties. We will utilize ex-vivo, whole heart explants in vagal-sparing Langendorf preparations in an established murine model of AF. Vagal nerve stimulation protocols and catecholamine infusion will mimick local autonomic activity. We will measure atrial conductive properties (phase slope changes, after depolarizations, ectopy) at baseline, with infusion of NPY, and with Y2R antagonists. If, as we hypothesize, vagolysis leads to triggered AF, and NPY blockade rescues the arrhythmia burden, we will have established an innovative, causal mechanism in the pathogenesis of AF.\nOur lab is uniquely suited to explore these questions, as a leading center of murine and induced pluripotent stem cell models of atrial arrhythmias. We have demonstrated competence in patch clamping and measurement of cardiac tissue conductive properties through Langendorf preparations, and are able to leverage our extensive electrophysiological expertise with both basic and clinical scientists. Not only does this proposal explore the novel contribution of vagolysis in arrhythmogenesis, it identifies a pharmacological target for potential interventions.\nWe are thankful for the opportunity to discuss our proposal with the Review Committee, and welcome the opportunity to share any additional information as requested.\nAnish S.

Additionally, a key middle author publication in JAMA “Association of Mental Stress-Induced Myocardial Ischemia with Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Coronary Heart Disease” (PMID: 34751708).\nSoftware development: During the learning of MATLAB, R, and other biostatistical techniques, I was able to generate and publish software on cosinor analyses, recurrent event analyses, and DAG-oriented modeling. These are actively maintained software packages that are furthering in development.\n\n\n\n\nComputational: The project has allowed me to develop an extensive technical skill base using programming techniques to learn biostatistics and signal processing. I have now become proficient in R and MATLAB, and routinely use this software on a daily basis.\nClinical: I have entered and finished a majority of clinical cardiology training, and will expand my knowledge base as a researcher prior to entering clinical electrophysiology. I have made broad connections with federally funded investigators and continue to expand my pool of mentors.\n\n\n\nI have published within both JAHA, IJC, and JAMA, along with sending publications in abstract form to local and national conferences.\n\n\n\nI plan to complete data collection on patients being enrolled at my research center (Emory), and develop a translational model in animals to evaluate this further with my other mentors."

    "text": "Kevin Purkiser and James Hennigan\nNational Institutes of Health\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\nEpidemiology Branch\nDear Drs. Purkiser and Hennigan,\nThank you for your response to my progress report. I apologize for the areas requiring revisions, and I appreciate the opportunity to do so, as my first time going through the NIH grant process. Below is the initial revision request, quoted:\n\n1) It’s not clear what has been accomplished in the past year toward your specific aims. The aims indicated in the competing application are to quantify the relationship between depressive symptoms and ANS dysfunction, and examine the relationship of obstructive CAD with ANS dysfunction and its potential dose response relationship. You indicate you have completed your Master’s thesis, participated in electrophysiology and other clinical training, analyzed mice models and stem cell models, and developed software. These are all great accomplishments, however, please clarify what you have done pursuant to the project’s specific aims.\n2) You cite 3 publications, however, these were all published before the start of this project. Table C.1. should include only publications directly arising from this project. Please remove these publications from table C.1.\n3) Enrollment: we acknowledge the continuing pandemic would cause enrollment to be lower than anticipated, however we are a little surprised there has been no enrollment at all, and the project is heading into its final year. Please send us your current enrollment for this project in 3 months.\n4) Some sections have been duplicated in the report (i.e. accomplishments, products, etc). Please resend the report deleting these duplications.\n\nAnish S. Shah, MD, MS\nF32 Postdoctoral Fellow\nDivision of Cardiology\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago\n(e) ashah282@uic.edu\n(c) 469-835-7606\n(p) 773-222-5619\n\n1. Accomplishments and Specific Aims\nIn summary, my aims were to evaluate the relationship of stress, autononomic dysfunction, and structural/ischemic heart disease. Due to the limitations of enrollment over the past several years, my mentors and I addressed this early on by delaying the start of the grant and diversifying the population we evaluated. We broadened the term depression to include other forms of psychological stress and evaluated additional cohorts. This was a natural extension of my work on neurocardiac pathophysiology that began under my previous TL1 grant. As quoted below:\n\nAim 1. Quantify the relationship between depressive symptoms and ANS dysfunction.\nAim 2. Examine the relationship of obstructive CAD with ANS dysfunction and its potential dose-response relationship.\n\nFor both of these aims, I needed additional background training in the measurement of autonomic physiology using electrocardiogram metrics and the evaluation of coronary artery disease through multiple imaging modalities. I used three cohorts: 1) Biobank Cohort (coronary angiography and heart rate variability via electrocardiogram patch), 2) Emory Twins Study (myocardial perfusion imaging and 24-hour Holter monitoring) and 3) Myocardial Ischemia and Mental Stress (mental stress challenge with both myocardial perfusion imaging and coronary angiography). This led to several accomplishments, both formal and informal, within my training plan.\nBiobank Cohort\n\nUtilizing the Master of Science in Clinical Research degree awarded from the TL-1 program, I successfully completed and the appropriate training needed to enroll patients for this project. I was able to consent and enroll over 50 individuals myself, and also trained part of our research team to enroll patients on my behalf.\nI learned how to organized and safely/confidentially store data using REDCap, creating an efficient standardized operating protocol for enrollment of patients. This is actively being used by our study staff to include more patients (usually several per week).\nI developed computational and signal processing skills to be able to interpret ECG data collected directly from enrolled patients. This ECG data serves as a surrogate for autonomic function by measuring heart rate variability, and allows an understanding of dynamic changes in sympathovagal balance.\n\nEmory Twins Study\n\nTo help evaluate changes in autonomic tone that may be circadian in nature, I wrote statistical software to analyze changes in heart rate variability by time of day through the cosinor method of harmonic regressions. This is a work in progress but the first software package was released this year online.\nI’ve initially analyzed this data and related it to the burden of depressive symptoms. This is a work-in-progress to become a manuscript hopefully in the next year.\n\nMyocardial Ischemia and Mental Stress\n\nI analyzed data involving acute psychological stress responses of heart rate and correlated this with cardiovascular mortality. This has subsequently turned into a first-author manuscript that is under revision with Circulation.\nThis same cohort analysis (which showed a strong relationship between vagolysis and psychological stress), was accepted as an abstract at ACC 2023 of this year.\n\nIn summary, my findings pursuant to the specific aims are 1) association of depression and psychological stress with autonomic dysfunction and 2) association of autonomic dysfunction with cardiovascular mortality. These findings have led to software development, manuscript authorship, biostatistical analytical skills, and further learning in signal processing, which are all directly related to my overall training plan and specific aims.\n\n\n2. Publications and Products\nThe F32 was activated in December 2021. Since this time, there have been no manuscripts published, however I have drafted and submitted a manuscript that directly relates autonomic dysfunction under acute psychological stress with cardiovascular mortality, which is currently under revision in Circulation. This manuscript was also accepted in the form of an abstract to the American College of Cardiology 2023 Conference.\nDuring this time, I have continued to work on patient enrollment to achieve adequate power (Biobank Cohort) to evaluate the dose-relationship between autonomic dysfunction and coronary artery disease.\n\n\n3. Enrollment\nThe enrollment documentation was submitted incorrectly. During the last year, we have seen an increase in the number of enrollments into the primary Biobank Cohort study.\nThe enrollment involves patients with suspected coronary artery disease that are undergoing routine/clinically-indicated coronary angiography. Continuous electrocardiogram data is being collected via ECG patch, that is subsequently being analyzed by myself. During their enrollment, the patients are being assessed for depressive symptom burden.\nEnrollment Table:\n\n\n\nEthnicity\nFemale\nMale\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Indian\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nAsian\n1\n11\n12\n\n\nBlack\n9\n14\n23\n\n\nWhite\n20\n27\n47\n\n\nUnknown/Mixed\n4\n2\n6\n\n\nTotal\n34\n54\n88"

    "text": "Aim #2: Translational\n\nDetermine the intracardiac characteristics of vagally-triggered AF. Structural and electrical features assessed through EPS will identify separate clinically-relevant phenotypes of AF.\n\nWe will collect electroanatomical mapping data and electrogram recordings during PVI of paroxysmal AF. Using signal processing and feature reduction, we will identify clusters of structural and electrical AF that correlate with those identified in 1a.\nWe will apply physiological stress and psychological stress through catecholamine infusion and mental stress challenge, respectively. Catecholamine infusion will lead to ↑NE, ↑NPY, ↑Gal expression while mental stress will lead to ↑NE, ↑NPY, ↑Gal expression\nIn those with suspected vagally-triggered AF, there will be an increased risk of Y2R and Gal1R receptor polymorphisms.\n\n\n\n\nICNS = intracardiac nervous system; EPS = electrophysiology study; PVI = pulmonary vein isolation; HRV = heart rate variability;"
