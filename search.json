    "text": "Aim 3: Evaluate the role of cardiovagal receptor genotypes in the risk of vagally-triggered arrhythmias. We hypothesize that novel variants exist that may explain the risk of vagally-triggered arrhythmias. A subset of patients identified with both decreased rest and reactivity cardiovagal outflow and increased CV mortality have been identified. Genetic analysis will be performed to discover novel mechanisms and biomarkers of arrhythmia risk. Identified variants will be validated in a separate cohort to evaluate the arrhythmia risk and electrical phenotypes identified in Aim 1 and 2."
