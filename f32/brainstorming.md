# Long-term plans

Long term would like to end up with applied physiology lab
Want to study more than individual folk
Epidemiology to test for mechanisms in larger populations
Professor/attending in medicine/cardiology

# Central hypothesis

Autonomic dysfunction leads to decrease in VFT
	Likely autonomic (e.g. circadian pattern)
	SCD risk remains large/unexplained
No known mechanisms or methods to identify patients at risk
No interventions (outside of ICDs) to intervene

# Steps forward

## R series

Epi studies to identify patients with worse outcomes
Study effect of interventions on overall outcomes
Applied physiology to study stress reactivity

## K grant

Applied physiology studies
Focus on HRV/ECG findings and stress reactivity

## F grant

Need tangible/incremental specific aims
Don't make it too "big",
	- incorporating projects with MSNA may be overwhelming
Needs to be with an R01-funded mentor

### Brainstorming

- measure alternative ECG markers and compare with MSNA data
- use machine learning algorithm to compare ECG data with gold standard of MSNA data... feature identification
- GEH maybe helpful, more as an acute marker than as a chronic marker
- compare mental stress to ECG and MSNA data?
- stress reactivity index of some kind
- occlusion plethysmography as surrogate SNS tone

### What is the story of the F32?

Have 2 years of funding
Work with EPICORE group
	But also dabble in applied physiology and computational bioinformatics
Goal is to be academic cardiologist studying autonomic dysfunction
Detecting non-invasive surrogates for worse outcomes / autonomic risk

### Specific Aims

#### Background

Psychological stress is bad.
	Likely due to changes in sympathovagal balance
	Vagal withdrawal increases risk
	High sympathetic tone increases risk
ANS function can be quantified in several ways
	Invasive/extensive
		MSNA
		Reactive hyperemia 
		Venous adrenergic
	Non-invasive
		ECG morphology (T wave area, 
		Time-independent HRV (e.g. geometric, PSA)
		Time-dependent HRV (e.g. HRT, Dyx)
Quantification of ANS tone
	Identifying ANS tone can identify at-risk individuals
	Can also test if treatment/interventions are successful
Importance
	Few studies look at MSNA and ECG findings in real-time?

#### Hypothesis

- disturbances of neurocardiac axis lead to ANS dysfunction
- quantified measures of ANS tone will reflect brain and heart metrics
- ECG measures reflect this (PEP, T wave repolarization, HRV)

#### Aims

Determine relationship between MSNA and ECG findings during mental stress.
	P-wave morphology
	GEH
	TWA
Measure correlation of MSNA with other non-invasive measures of autonomic tone
	SKNA
	VOP
	ML to detect ECG features that associate with MSNA

ECG data and cardiac catherization
	Have already enrolled ~ 200 patients
	Will have up to 2 years of data follow-up and outcomes
	Refine feature analysis and algorithm to detect CAD
	Add retrospective data on prior stress test (heavy chart review)
	Add machine learning or digital signal processing coursework
MSNA and ECG clinical outcomes
	MSNA data has been collected with Jeanie Park
