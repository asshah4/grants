## K23 hypothesis

Sympathetically-mediated paroxysmal AF is a [distinct mechanistic phenotype of AF]{.underline} that has unique [clinical]{.red} and [electrophysiological characteristics]{.red} that associate with more frequent, *staccato* episodes of AF, occurring more commonly in structurally normal atria.

[*This is in comparison to [scar-mediated phenotypes of AF]{.underline}.*]{.grey}

## Aims

1. Identify electrocardiographic phenotypes of paroxysmal AF with structurally normal atria.
2. [Determine the electrophysiological characteristics of sympathetically-mediated paroxysmal AF.]{.red}
3. Evaluate the role of genetic variants in cardiovagal receptors in sympathetically-mediated paroxysmal AF.

## Current status

- Collected 800k ECG of patients with AF, along with clinical histories, burden, medication changes
- Collected ~600 genomes of patients with AF of various comorbidity burdens
- Working on research to help identify phenotypes of AF, and understand trajectory/progression of AF

## Goals for EP fellowship

- Research project that can align with being a clinical EP, e.g. collect data from EPS (leveraging background in signal processing and machine learning)
- Focus on autonomic association with atrial arrhythmias (particularly AF)
- Consider mental stress testing and cardiovagal control during EPS

## Electrophysiology mechanisms {.smaller}

- APD variability in the atria precede onset of AF at rapid pacing rates [@vanStaveren2020]
- AERP measurement durnig extrastimuli protocols (e.g. bottom quintile of fibrillatory intervals from endocardium) [@Capucci1995]
- Two studies that have looked at mental stress and EPS are quite small (`n = 10` & `n = 12`), but neither looked at atrial properties [@Insulander2003; @Finlay2016]

## Molecular mechanisms {.smaller}

- Sympathetic/adreneric neurons release catecholamines (NE) that directly affect the myocardium
- NPY and galanin is also released, which both inhibit cholinergic activity [@Herring2015; @Herring2012]
- Both inhibit firing and leading to vagolytic effects on the myocardium[@Kalla2020; @Herring2008]
	- Galanin released as a adrenergic co-transmitter, binding to GalR1 receptors
	- NPY binds to cholinergic neurons through the Y2 receptor
	- Both directly/indirectly involve protein kinase C
- NPY receptors exist along the neurocardiac axis, including adrenal medulla (Y3) and cardiac tissue (Y2)[@Coote2013]

## Proposal ideas

1. Measure of EPS parameters during mental stress: evaluate HRV changes and intracardiac changes simultaneously 
1. Measure neuropeptide Y, epinephrine, and galanin levels before, during, and after
1. Cardiac autonomic modulation with vagal stimulation $\pm$ atropine during EPS
1. 24-hour Holter monitor before and after AF ablation to assess changes in ANS, and potentially more distant recordings to assess "autonomic recovery"
