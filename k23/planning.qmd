::: {.column width="50%"}
**Electrophysiology Study**

-   Baseline and post-procedural atrial conduction properties
-   Coronary sinus + circulating blood samples (including DNA)
-   Surface + intracardiac mapping and electrophysiological signal
-   Vagal nerve stimulation
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Big Data**

-   Cohort generated from population-level data (UIC/CCTS, ARIC, MVP/VAMC)
-   Computational model to classify AF based on clinical + cardiac imaging features

:::
:::

::: aside
UIC = University of Illinois at Chicago; CCTS = Center for Translational Research; ARIC = Atherosclerotic Risk in Communities;
:::

## Outcomes

-   Mechanisms explored could identify candidate subjects for NPY2R/Gal1R receptor blockade or VNS therapy
-   Efficacy of VNS therapy could be quantified through serum testing
-   Genetic variants that affect autonomic function along the neurocardiac axis may interplay with known inherited arrhythmis, such as the vagal-mediated triggers of SCD in LQTS patients

::: aside
SCD = sudden cardiac death; LQTS = Long QT syndrome

# Background

## Autonomic control of the heart {.smaller}

-   Neurocardiac axis is a hierarchical system of SNS and PNS afferent/efferent circuits that interact at multiple levels [@Armour1997]
    -   Cortex ↔ brainstem
    -   Spinal cord ↔ extracardiac ganglia (e.g. stellate)
    -   Intrinsic cardiac nervous system (ICNS) ↔ heart
-   Autonomic regulation is critical in the development of most CV disease
    -   Disregulated catecholamines in heart failure
    -   Post myocardial infarct VF
    -   Triggered arrhythmias such as VT

::: aside
SNS = sympathetic nervous system; PNS = parasympathetic nervous system;
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Cardiac neurotransmission @Shivkumar2016a](../figures/shivkumar-2022_neurocardiac-axis.png){#fig-neurocardiac-axis}

## Neurovisceral integration

-   **Lower levels** of networked structures (ICNS, hypothalamus) integrate afferent information about metabolic demands
-   **Higher levels** of networked structures (amydala, cortex) integrate lower networks and generate conscious/uncscious CV state representations
-   Allows for environmental/psychological factors to interplay with cardiac physiology, e.g. [mental stress]{.blue} causing [arrhythmia]{.orange}

## Critical role of the vagus {.smaller}

-   Embryologically, vagus nerve sprouts from medulla and extends to distant organs (thus long pre-ganglionic axons) e.g. heart, lung, intestines
-   Parasympathetic control is evolutionarily more primitive in vertebrates, preceeding sympathetic control
    -   Sharks exhihibt phasic HRV without sympathetic innervation [@Taylor2022]
    -   Mammalian vagal control is more complex, with multiple nuclei, e.g. polyvagal [@Porges2009]
-   Mammalian vagal outflow is particularly coupled with cardiorespiratory control
    -   Leads to [respiratory sinus arrhythmia]{.orange}
    -   Respiratory changes occur at a high-frequency, can be [measured by HRV]{.green}

::: aside
Stephen Porges proposed the Polyvagal Theory during his tenure at UIC.
HRV = heart rate variability;
:::

## Vagal therapeutic interventions {.smaller}

-   Chronic VNS reduces drop in ejection fraction in different animal models of cardiomyopathy, including MI, but studies have mixed results in humans
    -   NECTAR-HF \~ VNS or sham, no difference at 6 months in LV size/function, n = 96
    -   INOVATE-HF \~ right VNS + GDMT vs. GDMT, no difference in mortality, n = 700
    -   ANTHEM-HF \~ non-randomized VNS, improved LV function, pilot study (*required titrated VNS to cause decrease in HR*)
-   VNS may be anti-arrhythmic in animal models, with decreased VT/VF, but minimal human studies
    -   GANGLIA-AF, paroxysmal AF randomized to PVI or atrial GP ablation, decreased AAD dosages in GP group, n = 102

::: aside
VNS = vagal nerve stimulation; MI = myocardial infarction; LV = left ventricle; GP = ganglionated plexi; AAD = anti-arrhythmic drugs
:::

## Sympathovagal crosstalk {.smaller}

-   Arrhythmia thresholds affected by sympathetic and vagal activity
-   Intracardiac cross-talk between adrenergic (sympathetic) and cholinergic (vagal) neurons in the hierarchy of neurocardiac axis is critical for arrhythmogenesis during mental stress
-   Atria are heavily innervated by autonomic ganglionic plexi, leading to the complex activity that regulates cardiac conductive properties[@Hoover2009; @Armour1997]
-   Sympathetic nervous activity is slower onset, but vagolysis is rapid, thus being a more likely causal component of arrhythmogenesis

## Molecular mechanisms {.smaller}

-   Sympathetic/adreneric neurons release catecholamines (NE) that directly affect the myocardium
-   NPY and galanin is also released, which both inhibit cholinergic activity [@Herring2015; @Herring2012]
-   Both inhibit firing and leading to vagolytic effects on the myocardium[@Kalla2020; @Herring2008]
    -   Galanin released as a adrenergic co-transmitter, binding to GalR1 receptors
    -   NPY binds to cholinergic neurons through the Y2 receptor
    -   Both directly/indirectly involve protein kinase C
-   NPY receptors exist along the neurocardiac axis, including adrenal medulla (Y3) and cardiac tissue (Y2)[@Coote2013]

::: aside
NE = nor epinephrine; NPY = neuropeptide Y

# Aim #1

## 

{{< include _aim-one.qmd >}}

## Premises {.smaller}

1.  **Paroxysmal** AF requires both a trigger and a substrate to progenerate
2.  Paroxysmal, early AF rallies primarily through triggered activity
3.  Firing mechanisms occurs primarily from pulmonary veins due to:
    -   Enhanced automaticity
    -   Myocardial micro-reentry
    -   Triggered activity
4.  Electrical abnormalities preceed ± cause mechanical changes (fibrosis, myocardial disarray, leading to increased pre-disposed substrate
5.  Long-standing, chronic/persistent AF sustains primarily through substrate

## Phenotyping {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
__Identify patients with early (in terms of natural history) paroxysmal AF that have higher trigger burden (compared to fibrosis burden)__
:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
Currently, phenotyping is limited. PhenoKB uses binary diagnosis of AF (2012), while recent studies showed 4 potential clusters may exist. [@Pastori2020; @Vitolo2021]

1. Younger, lower comorbidities
2. High CV risk factors
3. High CV comorbidities
4. High rates of non-CV comorbidities (e.g. cancer)
