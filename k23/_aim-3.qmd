__Aim 3: Evaluate the role of genetic variants in neural and cardiac tissue in the incidence and progression of AF.__
We will identify novel and known variants in whole exome sequencing data that may be related to AF risk, including genes present in the neurocardiac axis. 
Using a Mendelian randomization approach, we will assess the relationship of rare and novel variants with paroxysmal AF. 
*Hypothesis*: [Variants in genes that regulate the neurocardiac axis will be associated with increased risk of paroxysmal AF in structurally normal atria]{.underline}.
