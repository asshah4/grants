**Aim 3: Explore the genetic and epigenetic determinants of autonomic dysfunction that predispose to AF.** 
*Hypothesis: Genetic variants associated with neurocardiac regulation, and epigenetic changes on similar trait loci, increases the risk of future AF occurrence.* 
By creating a polygenic risk for abnormal neurocardiac responses to mental stress (the Emory Myocardial Ischemia and Mental Stress study), key neurocardiac genes can be identified. 
By evaluating those genes, and their epigenetic modifications, in large biobank databases (Million Veterans Project, UK Biobank), we can quantifiy part of the polygenic and allostatic contribution to AF.
