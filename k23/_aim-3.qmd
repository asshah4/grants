__Aim 3: Evaluate the association of polygenic risk scores for chronic stress disorders with risk of atrial arrhythmias.__
We [hypothesize that]{.underline} SNPs associated with stress disorders have differential susceptibility (or resilience) to future arrhythmias. We will validate our findings in the UK Biobank using a two-sample Mendelian randomization study design.
