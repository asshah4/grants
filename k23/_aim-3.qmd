**Aim 3: Explore the contribution of ANS genetic variants to the polygenic risk of atrial arrhythmias.**
Using a two-sample Mendelian randomization study design, we will identify SNPs that contribute to stress-related disorders, including potentially novel loci, and assess their impact on the polygenic risk of AF in a validation cohort. 
[Hypothesis]{.underline}: Genetic variants associated with abnormalities in the ANS, including stress-related disorders, will overlap with and partially explain both risk and resilience to future development of AF.
