# Hook, Known Info, Gap, Critical Need

- AF is #1 common arrhythmia disorder worldwide
- pAF prevalence of > 50 million, with >25% lifetime risk in white and blacks
- dz is classified in broad strokes (paroxysmal, persistent, permanent)
- Mgmt is homogenous in terms of rhythm/rate strategies
- we need to have better classification of AF so we can treat it individually
- therapies may not need to be only targeted using ablation and/or antiarrhythmic mgmt

# Long-term Goal, Proposal, Rational, Hypothesis

- personalized mgmt of pAF, including early identification and risk stratification
- after identification, could personalize treatment
- propose that in pAF, as >50% of dx are of "low comorbid" phenotype, could better classify this
- SUspect that there are triggered v. re-entrant subphenotypes, driven by ANS triggers
- vagolytic triggers could be assessed from population level in terms of AF phenotypes
- Would compare that with EPS/EAM findings to identify triggered subtypes
- Would then look at pts c- increased vagolysis risk and hard outcomes to evaluate/find novel variants
- Use AF cohort to compare these variants

# Aims, Strategy, Outcome

__Aim 1: Identify triggered subphenotypes of pAF.__ 
*Intracardiac and extracardiac electrical features will [classify pAF into triggered versus re-entrant subphenotypes]{.underline}.* 
Population level data will be leveraged to identify clinical subphenotypes of pAF, incorporating ECG and echocardiography markers, arrhythmia burden, recurrence, and time-varying components of potential risk-factors.
These subphenotypes will be compared against intracardiac findings, including EGM and EAM data, to validate triggered arrhythmia.

__Aim 2: Determine the role of autonomic mechanisms in triggered pAF.__ 
*Triggered pAF will be associated with [increased electrical and neurohormonal biomarkers of vagolysis]{.underline}.*  
Neuropsychological markers of stress will be obtained through clinical interview prior to PVI, and will be clinically phenotyped (__Aim 1__).
Coronary sinus levels of NPY, Gal, S100B and arrhythmia thresholds will be obtained before and after PVI, and at the time of any additional physiological testing (catecholamine infusion, vagal nerve stimulation).

__Aim 3: Evaluate the role of cardiovagal receptor genotypes in the risk of vagally-triggered arrhythmias.__
*We hypothesize that [novel variants exist]{.underline} that may explain the risk of vagally-triggered arrhythmias.*
A subset of patients identified with both decreased rest and reactivity cardiovagal outflow and increased CV mortality have been identified. 
Genetic analysis will be performed to discover novel mechanisms and biomarkers of arrhythmia risk.
Identified variants will be validated in a separate cohort to evaluate the arrhythmia risk and electrical phenotypes identified in __Aim 1__ and __2__.

# Innovation, Outcomes, Impact

- Could potentially identify vagal triggered pathway 
- Would allow for intervention at Y2R and Gal1R blockade
- Novel approach to decreasing arrhythmia risk
