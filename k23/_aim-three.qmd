__Aim 3: Evaluate the role of genetic variants in cardiovagal receptors for the risk of trigger-predominant pAF through Mendelian randomization.__
Using a two-sample Mendelian randomization study, we will identify patients with genetic variants in a phenotyped cohort with maladaptive autonomic responses. *The identified variants [will associate with increased arrhythmia burden]{.underline} of pAF,* as assessed in __Aim 1__ and __2__.
