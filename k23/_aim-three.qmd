__Aim 3: Explore the role of vagolysis in triggered AF.__
In a prospective subgroup in the UIC Atrial Arrhythmia Registry with triggered AF, we will measure biomarkers of vagolysis during electrophysiology studies (ablation).
We will collect *cardiac-specific (coronary sinus) blood samples*. 
In triggered AF, there will be [increased levels of NPY and Gal]{.underline}.
After ablation, there will be [blunted heart rate variability]{.underline}.
