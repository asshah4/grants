__Aim 3: Evaluate the role of genetic variants in cardiovagal receptors in sympathetically-driven paroxysmal AF.__


In the MIMS cohort, stress-induced vagolysis was measured through ECG parameters,
We will identify if *common genetic variants in the cardiovagal receptors, including GAL1R and NPY2R*, are associated with vagolysis in the MIMS cohort.
We hypothesize that [variants associated with vagolysis will be associated with increased risk of paroxysmal AF in structurally normal atria]{.underline} in the AF Registry.
