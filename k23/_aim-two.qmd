__Aim 2: Determine the role of autonomic mechanisms in triggered pAF.__ 
*Triggered pAF will be associated with [increased electrical and neurohormonal biomarkers of vagolysis]{.underline}.*
Neuropsychological markers of stress will be obtained through clinical interview prior to PVI, and will be clinically phenotyped (__Aim 1__).
Coronary sinus levels of NPY, Gal, S100B and arrhythmia thresholds will be obtained before and after PVI, and at the time of any additional physiological testing (catecholamine infusion, vagal nerve stimulation).
