__Aim 2: Determine the electrophysiological characteristics of sympathetically-mediated paroxysmal AF.__
In a prospective subgroup in the AF Registry with paroxysmal AF, we will measure biomarkers of chronic, increased sympathetic activation during electrophysiology studies, including cardiac-specific levels of NPY and Gal.
*Hypothesis*: [Elevated levels of NPY and Gal will be associated inversely with the level of scar.]{.underline}.
