__Aim 2: Evaluate the role of vagolysis in paroxysmal AF.__
In a prospective subgroup in the AF Registry with paroxysmal AF, we will *measure biomarkers of vagolysis during electrophysiology study including intracardiac conduction parameters and cardiac-specific levels of NPY and Gal.* 
We hypothesize that A) [increased vagolysis will be associated with structurally normal atria]{.underline}, and B) [increased vagolysis will be associated with increased risk of AF recurrence]{.underline}.
