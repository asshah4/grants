__Aim 2: Determine the role of autonomic mechanisms in subphenotypes of pAF.__ 
*Trigger-predominant pAF will be associated with [increased electrical and neurohormonal biomarkers of vagolysis]{.underline}* 
The subphenotype of pAF will be supported by findings from __Aim 1__. Our measure of vagolysis will include increased levels of NPY and Gal (coronary sinus blood), decreased arrhythmia thresholds (intracardiac electrograms), and decreased high frequency HRV (ECG), measured during EPS.
