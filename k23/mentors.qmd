## Big picture {.smaller}

::: {.callout-important}
Why do large, underwater mammals, with respectively __larger atria__ have low burden of atrial fibrillation? Why do arrhythmias only occur on __ascent phase of dive__?
:::

1. Plan to be with translational cardiac electrophysiologist, focusing on signal processing, molecular/genetic mechanisms, and the autonomic nervous system
1. Underlying question is how [stress can lead to arrhythmogenesis]{.underline}
1. Study how arrhythmia events are mediated by potential [inappropriate vagolytic mechanisms in atrial fibrillation]{.underline}.
1. Long-term goal is to [phenotype AF]{.underline} and develop targeted, individualized therapies (e.g. functional mapping, alternative boundary predictions in EP)

## Current projects {.smaller}

- ECG-based prediction of severity of TTN variants using deep learning (computational/genetics)
- Machine learning for annotations of EGM (computational)
- Phenotyping paroxysmal AF based on ECG and TTE criteria (epidemiology)
- Mental *stress reactivity* and CVD mortality (epidemiology)
- AFEQT and social determinants of health in minority population (epidemiology)
- "Isolated" or "premature" AFL with family history (genetics)
- Cosinor/harmonic regression software (computational)
- GWAS of abnormal *stress reactivity*

## Non-specific aims

1. Epidemiology / ECG-based aim: risk prediction, machine learning (i.e. ECG-informed arrhythmia risk scores)
1. EP-lab based aim: repolarization mapping, intra-EPS stress testing
1. Genetics-focused aim: TTN impact on AF, genetics of stress physiology (e.g. HRV)

## Research network {.smaller}

- Amit J. Shah, MD, MSCR (Emory) = cardiologist $\rightarrow$ __Rob MacLeod, PhD__
- Alvaro Alonso, MD, PhD (Emory) = epidemiologist, ARIC, atrial fibrillation
- Viola Vaccarino, MD, PhD (Emory) = epidemiologist, mental stress
- Arshed Quyyumi, MD (Emory) = cardiologist, coronary disease
- Rachel Lampert, MD (Yale) = electrophysiologist, mental stress
- Dawood Darbar, MD (UIC) = electrophysiologist, genetics, atrial fibrillation $\rightarrow$ __Martin Tristani-Firouzi, MD__
- Emelia Benjamin, MD, ScM (BU) = cardiologist, epidemiologist, atrial fibrillation, genetics (AFGen Consortium)

## Research at Utah {.smaller}

- MacLeod = signal processing for ECG/EGM data
- Ranjan = MRI and structural evaluation of atria (in AF)
- Bunch = AF and cognitive decline (area of interest of __Alvaro Alonso__ as well)
- Tristani-Firouzi = genetics of arrhythmias, Utah Population Database
- Palatinus = molecular mechanisms of current trafficking
- Guo = genetics/VUS and CVD mechanisms
- Dosdall = EGM/arrhythmia mapping, activation patterns

## Wrap-up

- Opinions and thoughts
- Questions/concerns
