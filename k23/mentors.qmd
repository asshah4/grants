## Draft of Aims {.center}

---

__Aim 1: Identify ECG-based phenotypes of paroxysmal AF.__
We will evaluate the ECG manifestation of (A) patterns of scar based on cardiac MRI/EPS, and (B) contributions of genetic variants in sarcomeric/structural proteins and ion channelopathies that are associated with AF. 
Our [working hypothesis]{.underline} is that scar-based atrial myopathy can be identified by ECG, and can distinguish between re-entry versus focal triggers for AF.

---

__Aim 2: Determine the differences in APD heterogeneity of scar tissue in the context of modulated autonomic activity.__
Our [working hypothesis]{.underline} is that the interaction between APD heterogeneity and autonomic modulation will predict differential risk for future AF, particularly in cases of abnormal baseline autonomic activity such as PTSD.

---

__Aim 3: Identify the role of novel, rare variants for future AF risk in stress-related conditions.__
Our [working hypothesis]{.underline} is that rare variants identified in a population with abnormal stress responses will be associated wiht increased future risk of AF in a large cohort study.

## ECG Prediction of Structural and Ion Channel Mutants in AF {.smaller}

This is an expansion of the __ECG/TTN__ project, which found [ECG could feasibly provide above-chance accuracy in identify TTN LOF variants]{.underline}.
Now, expand to additional *wild-types* and *mutants*...

- Sarcomeric/structural variants (e.g. TTN, PITX2, LMNA, NUP155, GJA1/5)
- Ionic channel variants (e.g. KCNE1-5, KCNQ1, SCN5A)
- No known genetic contributors (excluding any patient with non-benign VUS in any above genes $\pm$ SNPs associated with polygenic risk for AF)

## Big picture {.smaller}

::: {.callout-important}
Why do large, underwater mammals, with respectively __larger atria__ have low burden of atrial fibrillation? Why do arrhythmias only occur on __ascent phase of dive__?
:::

1. Plan to be with translational cardiac electrophysiologist, focusing on signal processing, molecular/genetic mechanisms, and the autonomic nervous system
1. Underlying question is how [stress can lead to arrhythmogenesis]{.underline}
1. Study how arrhythmia events are mediated by potential [inappropriate vagolytic mechanisms in atrial fibrillation]{.underline}.
1. Long-term goal is to [phenotype AF]{.underline} and develop targeted, individualized therapies (e.g. functional mapping, alternative boundary predictions in EP)

## Current projects {.smaller}

- ECG-based prediction of severity of TTN variants using deep learning (computational/genetics)
- Machine learning for annotations of EGM (computational)
- Phenotyping paroxysmal AF based on ECG and TTE criteria (epidemiology)
- Mental *stress reactivity* and CVD mortality (epidemiology)
- AFEQT and social determinants of health in minority population (epidemiology)
- "Isolated" or "premature" AFL with family history (genetics)
- Cosinor/harmonic regression software (computational)
- GWAS of abnormal *stress reactivity*

## Non-specific aims

1. Epidemiology / ECG-based aim: risk prediction, machine learning (i.e. ECG-informed arrhythmia risk scores)
1. EP-lab based aim: repolarization mapping, intra-EPS stress testing
1. Genetics-focused aim: TTN impact on AF, genetics of stress physiology (e.g. HRV)
