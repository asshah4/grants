__Aim 1: Investigate the clinical and electrophysiological determinants that identify trigger-predominant subphenotypes of pAF.__ 
*Trigger-predominant pAF [will have shorter, symptomatic episodes of AF with decreased atrial scar burden]{.underline}.*
Population level data will be leveraged to identify critical features of arrhythmia burden and recurrence, atrial pathology, and time-varying components of potential risk-factors obtained through clinical, ECG, and echocardiography markers.
These features will be validated against findings during EPS of conduction disease and atrial scarring.
