__Aim 1: Identify triggered subphenotypes of pAF.__ 
*Intracardiac and extracardiac electrical features will [classify pAF into triggered versus re-entrant subphenotypes]{.underline}.* 
Population level data will be leveraged to identify clinical subphenotypes of pAF, incorporating ECG and echocardiography markers, arrhythmia burden, recurrence, and time-varying components of potential risk-factors.
These subphenotypes will be compared against intracardiac findings to validate triggered arrhythmia phenotypes.
