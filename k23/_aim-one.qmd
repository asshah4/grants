__Aim 1: Identify phenotypes of paroxysmal AF with structurally normal hearts.__
Clinical records, ECG parameters, and cardiac imaging will be leveraged within the AF Registry to *identify features associated with paroxysmal AF in structurally normal hearts*. 
We will evaluate the *difference in progression of AF from paroxysmal to persistent* using these features. 
We hypothesize that during EP studies, [features associated with structurally normal hearts will be associated with lower burden of scar.]{.underline}
