__Aim 1: Identify triggered phenotypes of paroxysmal AF.__ 

a. Using clinical records and ECG parameters in the UIC Atrial Arrhythmia Registry, *we will identify features associated with triggered AF*. Triggered AF will have [shorter, symptomatic episodes of AF without structural changes to the atria]{.underline}.
a. Using intracardiac signals from electrophysiological studies in a subgroup undergoing ablation in the UIC Atrial Arrhythmia Registry, *we will validate cases of triggered AF*. Triggered AF will have [minimal conduction disease and atrial scarring]{.underline}.
