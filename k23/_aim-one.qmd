__Aim 1: Identify triggered phenotypes of paroxysmal AF.__ 

a. Using clinical records and ECG parameters in the AF Registry, *we will identify features associated with triggered AF*. Triggered AF will have [shorter, symptomatic episodes of AF without structural changes to the atria]{.underline}.
a. Using intracardiac signals from EP studies in a subgroup of the AF Registry undergoing ablation, *we will validate cases of triggered AF and assess ANS function using ECG and EP study parameters*. Triggered AF will have [minimal conduction disease and atrial scarring]{.underline} and [maladaptive ANS responses]{.underline}.
