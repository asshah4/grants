__Aim 2: Determine the electrophysiological characteristics of sympathetically-triggered paroxysmal AF.__
In prospectively enrolled individuals with new-onset paroxysmal AF, we will perform electrophysiology studies to measure atrial parameters, including scar burden, conduction abnormalities, and changes in repolarization.
We will assess the effect of autonomic modulation on atrial tissue with normal and abnormal structural properties, confirming autonomic effects through assessment of cardiac-specific neurohormones.
*Hypothesis*: [During increased sympathetic activity and decreased vagal activity, action potential duration alternans will occur predominantly at borders of scar tissue as compared to scar or healthy tissue]{.underline}.
