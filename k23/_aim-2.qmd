__Aim 2: Determine the effect of autonomic changes in computational models of arrhythmia to predict differential risk for atrial arrhythmias.__
Our [working hypothesis]{.underline} is that by modifying dromotropic and lusitropic properties of computational models of atria, clinically-relevant arrhythmias can be elicited over that of fibrosis-based models alone.
