**Aim 2: Compare the efficacy of computational scar-based models of atrial arrhythmias with predictive models accounting for ANS.** 
We have designed predictive models of atrial arrhythmias based off of scar patterns identified by clinical imaging.
This aim will augment the models by incorporating ANS parameters.
[Hypothesis]{.underline}: Atrial-specific ANS parameters will improve prediction of clinically-relevant arrhythmias. 
[Secondary hypothesis]{.underline}: ANS parameters obtained from **Aim 1** will validate parameters utilized in computational models.
