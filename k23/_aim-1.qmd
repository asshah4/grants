**Aim 1: Measure the differential electrophysiologic effects of the ANS on the atrial substrate and risk for atrial arrhythmias.**
*[Hypothesis]{.underline}: EP characteristics with ANS modulation will show regional differences across the atria.* 
*[Secondary hypothesis]{.underline}: Scar tissue will have increased heterogeneity of refractoriness in response to ANS modulation, with an exaggerated shortening of APD, relative to baseline.*
During clinically-indicated EP studies for atrial arrhythmias, we will measure EP characteristics under ANS modulation through both pacing (e.g. vagal stimulation) and pharmacological maneuvers (e.g. isoproterenol infusion).
