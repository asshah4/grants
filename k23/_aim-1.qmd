__Aim 1: Identify ECG-based phenotypes of paroxysmal AF.__
We will evaluate the ECG manifestation of (A) patterns of scar based on cardiac MRI/EPS, and (B) contributions of genetic variants in sarcomeric/structural proteins and ion channelopathies that are associated with AF. 
Our [working hypothesis]{.underline} is that scar-based atrial myopathy can be identified by ECG, and can distinguish between re-entry versus focal triggers for AF.
