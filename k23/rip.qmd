## Updates {.smaller}

- AFEQT/SDOH paper revisions to be completed and sent to co-authors by end-of-month
- ECG/Genetics work-in-progress: meeting with Choi to "tighten" genetic variant selection
- AF/DM (DS)
  - Access to MUSE for updated ECG data (roughly 100k more to load), would need permission's reset by Diane Lepsi
  - Data pull (by me) for DM/AF cohort with matching controls
